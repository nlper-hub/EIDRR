# EIDRR

#ExPDTB folder: 

The ExPDTB folder is used to expand the PDTB corpus with annotated explanations. 

It contains three text files: training set, validation set, and the test set. The training and validation sets include explanations generated by large language model, while the test set contains no explanations. The content format within the files is as follows:

‘train_explanation.txt’：label||arg1||arg2 ||explanation

‘dev_explanation.txt’:    label||arg1||arg2 ||explanation

‘test.txt’: label|||arg1|||arg2

#test_explanation: 

The test_explanation folder contains the explanations generated by our framework for three tasks: IDRR, ABSA, and NLI.In each subfolder, there are two text files: "correct," which contains the correctly classified data, and "error," which contains the misclassified data. For subsequent evaluation, we only consider the data in the "correct" file. The format of the content is as follows: 

IDRR: arg1|||arg2|||gold label|||predict label|||explanation

‘ABSA’: sentence|||aspect term|||gold label|||predict label|||explanation

‘NLI.txt’: arg1|||arg2|||gold label|||predict label|||explanation

where the "gold label" refers to the actual label, while the "predict label" indicates the label predicted by the classification model.
