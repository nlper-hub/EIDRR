['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||This is an old story||We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .||The first sentence states that "This is an old story," suggesting that the events being discussed happened a long time ago. The second sentence provides additional information about the timeframe and context, specifying that the events occurred "years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties." This sentence expands on the idea presented in the first sentence by giving more detail about when the story takes place and what conditions were like at that time. Therefore, the second sentence offers an expansion of the information in the first sentence, explaining the temporal context and the relevant circumstances.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .||There is no asbestos in our products now . ''||The first sentence states that the discussion is about a time when people were unaware of asbestos' harmful properties.The second sentence asserts that there is no asbestos in the products currently. The expansion relationship is evident here because the second sentence provides additional information related to the topic of asbestos in the products, specifically addressing the current status of asbestos use. It expands on the context set by the first sentence, providing more detail about the present situation with asbestos in their products.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes .||We have no useful information on whether users are at risk||The first sentence indicates that both Lorillard and the researchers lacked knowledge about specific research on smokers of Kent cigarettes. The second sentence states that there is no useful information regarding the risks to users. The contingency relationship exists because the lack of awareness (first sentence) results in the absence of useful information (second sentence). In other words, due to the lack of existing research known to Lorillard and the researchers, they cannot provide useful information on the potential risks to users.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number .||Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer .||The first sentence states that out of 33 men who worked closely with a particular substance, 28 have died, which is more than three times the expected number. The second sentence provides additional information about the health outcomes for the surviving workers, noting that four out of the five survivors have asbestos-related diseases, including three recent cancer diagnoses. This additional detail expands on the severity of the health impact experienced by the workers, both deceased and living, thereby providing a fuller picture of the consequences of exposure to the substance. Thus, the second sentence expands the information provided in the first one by giving more details about the health issues faced by the survivors.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number . Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer .||The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected||The first sentence provides specific details about the high mortality rate and health issues among a group of 33 workers who were exposed to a particular substance: 28 have died, which is more than three times the expected number, and four out of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases, including three recent cancer diagnoses.The second sentence offers a broader summary of the health outcomes, stating that there were 18 deaths from conditions associated with asbestos exposure, which is significantly higher than what would be expected.The relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence broadens the scope of the information provided in the first sentence by summarizing the total number of deaths from asbestos-related diseases. The detailed information in the first sentence supports and expands upon the general statement in the second sentence, providing a clearer picture of the extent of the health impact on the workers.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||In July , the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos .||By 1997 , almost all remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed .||The first sentence states that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) imposed a gradual ban on most uses of asbestos in July. The second sentence indicates the outcome of this ban: by 1997, nearly all remaining uses of asbestos will be illegal. The relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, as the future state (almost all uses of asbestos being outlawed) is contingent upon the action taken by the EPA (imposing the ban). The second sentence depends on the first for its context and meaning, specifically the timeline and effect of the ban.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s .||Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used .||The first sentence states that about 160 workers at a factory producing paper for Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s. The second sentence provides additional details about the conditions of the exposure by specifying that areas using crocidolite (a form of asbestos) were particularly dusty. This further elaborates on the context of the asbestos exposure mentioned in the first sentence, making the relationship between the two sentences one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used .||Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters .||The first sentence indicates that certain areas of the factory were dusty due to the use of crocidolite. The second sentence describes a specific process involving the handling of materials, including the use of crocidolite, which could contribute to the dustiness mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the process described in the second sentence is contingent upon the condition of dustiness mentioned in the first sentence, as the process provides a possible cause for the observed dustiness.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||to indicate declining interest rates||a sign of rising rates||The first part of the sentence discusses "declining interest rates," while the second part talks about "a sign of rising rates." These two phrases are directly contrasting each other, comparing two different situations: one where interest rates are decreasing and another where they are increasing. This comparison helps to highlight the differences between the implications of declining versus rising interest rates.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds .||Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $ 1.5 billion during the latest week , to $ 352.7 billion .||The first sentence states that even though yields have decreased recently, investors are still investing heavily in money funds. The second sentence provides specific data showing assets of taxable funds increasing by $1.5 billion in the most recent week. This data exemplifies the continued investment mentioned in the first sentence, demonstrating the growth in assets. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the idea presented in the first sentence by providing concrete evidence of increased investment through the growth in assets.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Typically , money-fund yields beat comparable short-term investments .||The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9 % .||The first sentence makes a general statement that money-fund yields typically outperform similar short-term investments.The second sentence provides specific information about the current yield of top money funds, which is "well over 9%".This specific instance serves to expand upon the general statement by offering concrete evidence of the higher yields, supporting the claim made in the first sentence. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by providing a current example of high yields.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9 % .||Dreyfus World-Wide Dollar , the top-yielding fund , had a seven-day compound yield of 9.37 % during the latest week , down from 9.45 % a week earlier .||The first sentence states that the top money funds are yielding well over 9%. The second sentence provides specific details about one of these top-yielding funds, Dreyfus World-Wide Dollar, stating its exact seven-day compound yield for the most recent week (9.37%) and comparing it to the previous week (9.45%). This detailed information expands on the initial claim that top money funds are exceeding 9% yield, hence the relationship is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12 % , down from 8.14 % .||The 30-day simple yield fell to an average 8.19 % from 8.22 %||The first sentence provides information about the seven-day simple yield for the 400 funds, noting a decrease from 8.14% to 8.12%. The second sentence details another decrease, this time in the 30-day simple yield, dropping from 8.22% to 8.19%. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence provides additional, related information about a similar metric (30-day simple yield) also experiencing a decline. It further supports the idea presented in the first sentence by showing a consistent trend across different time frames.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12 % , down from 8.14 % . The 30-day simple yield fell to an average 8.19 % from 8.22 %||the 30-day compound yield slid to an average 8.53 % from 8.56 %||The first sentence states that there was a decrease in the average seven-day simple yield for the 400 funds, from 8.14% to 8.12%. The second sentence provides more detailed information about the decline in yields, specifically mentioning the 30-day simple yield falling from 8.22% to 8.19% and the 30-day compound yield decreasing from 8.56% to 8.53%. This additional data expands upon the initial statement by giving specific figures for the 30-day yields, both simple and compound, thereby providing a more comprehensive view of the downward trend in yields.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||For starters , the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist-comedian Victor Borge .||Champagne and dessert followed .||The first sentence describes an initial event where the executives attended an evening with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and Victor Borge. The second sentence then mentions that champagne and dessert followed this event. This sequence indicates that the second activity (champagne and dessert) occurred after the first one (the symphony and Victor Borge's performance), establishing a temporal relationship between the two sentences.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||The next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway , .||, so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests .||The first sentence describes an event where executives and their wives were taken to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway with a police escort. The second sentence mentions that the Lieutenant Governor welcomed these special guests. Given the relationship is temporal, we can infer that the welcoming likely happened after the group arrived at the Speedway. Thus, the sequence of events is that they first went to the Speedway and then were welcomed by the Lieutenant Governor, establishing a temporal connection.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||After the race , Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers .||No dummies , the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor 's name or two .||The first sentence indicates that following the race, Fortune 500 executives showed strong interest in the cars and drivers. The second sentence describes the drivers' response to this attention: they mentioned having space on their cars for additional sponsors. The drivers' action (pointing out available sponsorship space) is contingent upon the executives' behavior (showing interest). The drivers responded to the executives' interest by suggesting opportunities for sponsorship, thus creating a contingent relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||before boarding the buses again||This time , it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away .||The first sentence indicates a previous action related to boarding buses.The second sentence describes a subsequent bus boarding for a different purpose (dinner and dancing).The comparison relationship is established through the contrast between the two instances of boarding buses: the first unspecified instance and "this time" for dinner and dancing. The phrase "This time" suggests a comparison with a previous occasion, indicating that the current situation differs from the past experience.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom , nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline , lobster consomme , veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce .||, the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation .||The first sentence describes an event where nine popular chefs prepared and served a luxurious meal at the Indiana Roof Ballroom for an audience.The second sentence tells us that the executives responded to this meal with a standing ovation. The relationship is one of contingency because the chefs' actions (preparing and serving the food) led to the executives' reaction (giving a standing ovation). The standing ovation was contingent upon the chefs' successful preparation and presentation of the meal.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||South Korea 's economic boom , , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports .||exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion||The first sentence explains that South Korea's economic boom has stopped due to various reasons including labor disputes, trade conflicts, and sluggish exports. The second sentence provides additional detail about the situation with exports, specifying that they will likely fall short of a government target. This additional information expands on one of the reasons mentioned in the first sentence (sluggish exports), offering more context and specifics about the state of exports. Thus, the second sentence has an expansion relationship with the first, adding detail to the cause of the economic halt.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||From January to October , the nation 's accumulated exports increased 4 % from the same period last year to $ 50.45 billion .||Imports were at $ 50.38 billion , up 19 % .||The first sentence states that the nation's accumulated exports from January to October increased by 4% compared to the same period last year, reaching $50.45 billion. The second sentence discusses imports, which stood at $50.38 billion, marking a 19% increase. Although both sentences present growth figures, they focus on different aspects (exports and imports). However, the expansion relationship indicates that both sentences are part of a broader context of economic activity. The details provided in the second sentence (the amount and percentage increase of imports) serve to expand the economic picture started in the first sentence (the amount and percentage increase of exports). The relationship is expansion because the second sentence provides additional information related to the overall economic context introduced in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years .||Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies .||The first sentence introduces that Newsweek, which is a part of the Washington Post Co., has launched a new ad plan that is the second incentive-based plan they've offered within three years. The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining the nature of these plans: they offer discounts to advertisers who maintain or increase their ad spending, and such plans have become a standard feature at news magazines. Thus, the second sentence provides additional context and detail about the type of incentive plans mentioned in the first sentence, deepening our understanding of the situation.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in January||A full , four-color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 .||The first sentence states that Newsweek's ad rates would rise by 5% in January. The second sentence provides more specific information about what that rate increase means in terms of actual costs: a full, four-color page will now cost $100,980. The second sentence expands on the first by providing concrete numbers to illustrate the impact of the announced rate increase.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in January A full , four-color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 .||In mid-October , Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates ; with a lower circulation base , Time 's ad rate will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber ; a full page in Time costs about $ 120,000 .||The first sentence states that Newsweek's ad rates would increase by 5% in January and provides the cost of a full, four-color page. The second sentence discusses Time magazine lowering its circulation rate base without increasing ad page rates, resulting in an effectively higher rate per subscriber, and also provides the cost of a full page. These two sentences form a comparison by presenting the differing approaches of two competing magazines (Newsweek and Time) towards their advertising rates and the implications of these changes. The comparison highlights how each publication's strategy affects the relative cost per subscriber.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||In mid-October , Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates||with a lower circulation base , Time 's ad rate will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber||The first sentence states that Time magazine reduced its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 without raising ad page rates. The second sentence explains the result of this action: With a lower circulation base, the ad rate will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber. The contingency relationship is established because the effect (the increase in effective ad rate per subscriber) is contingent upon the cause (the reduction in circulation rate base without raising ad page rates).
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in January A full , four-color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 . In mid-October , Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates ; with a lower circulation base , Time 's ad rate will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber ; a full page in Time costs about $ 120,000 .||U.S. News has yet to announce its 1990 ad rates .||The first sentence provides information about Newsweek's ad rate increase and the specific cost of a full, four-color page. The second sentence introduces Time magazine's changes in circulation and ad rates, explaining how their adjustments result in a higher cost per subscriber compared to Newsweek. These details set up a comparison between the ad rates of Newsweek and Time. Additionally, the mention of U.S. News not having announced its 1990 ad rates further emphasizes the comparison by including another publication in the discussion. The relationship between the sentences is comparative because they discuss different publications' approaches to advertising rates.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan , which awards space credits to advertisers on `` renewal advertising||The magazine will reward with `` page bonuses '' advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending , as long as they spent $ 325,000 in 1989 and $ 340,000 in 1990 .||The first sentence introduces the Circulation Credit Plan and mentions that it awards space credits to advertisers on renewal advertising. The second sentence provides more specific details about how the plan works: advertisers who meet or exceed their 1989 spending in 1990 (with specified minimum amounts) will receive page bonuses. This additional information expands upon the initial description of the plan, explaining the conditions under which advertisers can receive rewards. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||However , none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently .||According to Audit Bureau of Circulations , Time , the largest newsweekly , had average circulation of 4,393,237 , a decrease of 7.3 % .||The first sentence states that none of the big three weeklies saw circulation gains recently. The second sentence provides specific details about Time magazine's circulation, showing a decrease of 7.3%. This detail expands upon the initial statement by providing concrete evidence of a decline for one of the mentioned weeklies, thus supporting the claim made in the first sentence with an example.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||According to Audit Bureau of Circulations , Time , the largest newsweekly , had average circulation of 4,393,237 , a decrease of 7.3 % .||Newsweek 's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453 , flat from the same period last year .||The first sentence provides information about Time magazine's circulation and its percentage decrease. The second sentence gives details about Newsweek's circulation during the first six months of 1989, noting that it remained unchanged from the previous year. These sentences establish a comparison between the two magazines by providing data on their circulations and respective changes over time. The relationship is comparative as it allows readers to understand how each magazine's circulation fared relative to the other and to their own past performances.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||According to Audit Bureau of Circulations , Time , the largest newsweekly , had average circulation of 4,393,237 , a decrease of 7.3 % . Newsweek 's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453 , flat from the same period last year .||U.S. News ' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328 , down 2.6 % .||The first sentence provides information about Time magazine's circulation and its percentage decrease. The second sentence gives details about Newsweek's circulation, noting that it remained flat compared to the previous year. This establishes a comparison between the changes in circulation for Time and Newsweek. Additionally, the third sentence introduces U.S. News' circulation figures and its decline, further expanding the comparison to include another newsweekly. Therefore, the relationship between all three sentences is one of comparison, as they discuss the circulation numbers and changes for different newsweeklies during the same time frame.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- did n't come true||`` When we evaluated raising our bid , the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years , and the rewards seemed a long way out .||The first sentence outlines the potential negative impact on the company's return on equity if certain conditions were not met when making a higher bid for PS of New Hampshire. These conditions include growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies.The second sentence expands on the concerns mentioned in the first sentence by providing more detail about the company's evaluation process. It explains that when considering raising the bid, the company recognized significant and persistent risks over the next five years, with the potential rewards seeming distant.Thus, the second sentence expands upon the risks mentioned in the first sentence, offering a deeper insight into the company's perspective on the risks associated with raising the bid.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||`` When we evaluated raising our bid , the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years , and the rewards seemed a long way out .||That got hard to take||The first sentence explains the company's evaluation of raising their bid, noting the perceived substantial and persistent risks over five years and distant rewards. The second sentence states that dealing with these factors became difficult. The relationship is one of contingency because the difficulty mentioned in the second sentence is contingent upon the conditions described in the first sentence. Essentially, the difficulty arises from the specific risks and rewards associated with raising the bid.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||that political concerns also worried New England Electric||No matter who owns PS of New Hampshire , after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation||The first sentence indicates that New England Electric had political concerns.The second sentence discusses a future situation regarding PS of New Hampshire's rates being high no matter the owner. This situation is contingent upon the company emerging from bankruptcy proceedings, which can be related to the broader context of political concerns mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the political concerns in the first sentence set the stage for understanding why the ownership and rate issues in the second sentence are significant, creating a relationship of contingency.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||`` That attracts attention ...||it was just another one of the risk factors '' that led to the company 's decision to withdraw from the bidding||The first sentence indicates something attracts attention, suggesting a notable event or situation. The second sentence explains that this situation was considered a risk factor in the company's decision-making process. The contingency relationship is evident because the company's decision to withdraw from the bidding (second sentence) was influenced by the attention-drawing event (first sentence). In other words, the fact that something attracted attention played a role in the company's decision, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||the withdrawal of New England Electric might speed up the reorganization process||The fact that New England proposed lower rate increases -- 4.8 % over seven years against around 5.5 % boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders -- complicated negotiations with state officials||The first sentence indicates that the withdrawal of New England Electric could accelerate the reorganization process. The second sentence provides context for why this might happen: New England proposed lower rate increases compared to other bidders, which complicated negotiations. This suggests that without New England Electric in the picture (due to its withdrawal), the negotiations could become less complex, potentially speeding up the reorganization. Therefore, the withdrawal's effect on the reorganization process is contingent upon the specific details of New England Electric's proposal and how it influenced negotiations.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The fact that New England proposed lower rate increases -- 4.8 % over seven years against around 5.5 % boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders -- complicated negotiations with state officials||Now the field is less cluttered||The first sentence provides information about the rate increases proposed by New England, which were lower than those proposed by the other two bidders. The second sentence discusses the current situation where the field is less cluttered, suggesting a change in the number of bidders or proposals. The comparison is evident because the second sentence implicitly refers back to the initial context of multiple bidders and highlights a difference in the situation (a reduction in complexity or competition). The relationship is one of comparison, as the second sentence contrasts the current state with the previously described scenario.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'nevertheless'] ||Separately , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission turned down for now a request by Northeast seeking approval of its possible purchase of PS of New Hampshire .||it would refile its request and still hopes for an expedited review by the FERC||The first sentence states that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has denied, for the moment, a request from Northeast for approval of a potential acquisition. The second sentence indicates the company's intention to refile its request and its hope for an expedited review by the FERC. The comparison relationship can be explained as follows: The denial of the initial request and the company's intention to refile it and still seek an expedited review indicate a contrast in the status of the request. While the FERC initially turned down the request, the company remains optimistic and plans to pursue approval again. This demonstrates a comparison between the current rejection and the company's ongoing efforts and hopes for a different outcome.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||State court Judge Richard Curry ordered Edison to make average refunds of about $ 45 to $ 50 each to Edison customers who have received electric service since April 1986 , including about two million customers who have moved during that period .||Judge Curry ordered the refunds to begin Feb. 1 and said that he would n't entertain any appeals or other attempts to block his order by Commonwealth Edison .||The first sentence states that State court Judge Richard Curry ordered Edison to issue refunds to its customers who have received electric service since April 1986. The second sentence provides additional details about when these refunds should start and Judge Curry's stance on appeals or attempts to block his order. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more specific information about the timeline and the judge's position regarding the enforcement of the refund order.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||that he would n't entertain any appeals or other attempts to block his order by Commonwealth Edison||The refund pool ... may not be held hostage through another round of appeals||The first sentence states that the judge would not entertain any appeals or other attempts to block his order by Commonwealth Edison. The second sentence expands on the idea by specifying what could happen if there were more appeals - the refund pool may not be held hostage. The second sentence provides additional detail about the consequences of the judge's decision, thus expanding on the initial statement.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||the ruling could force it to slash its 1989 earnings by $ 1.55 a share||For 1988 , Commonwealth Edison reported earnings of $ 737.5 million , or $ 3.01 a share .||The first sentence mentions the potential impact of a ruling on Commonwealth Edison's 1989 earnings, specifically a reduction of $1.55 per share. The second sentence provides information about Commonwealth Edison's actual earnings for 1988, which were $737.5 million or $3.01 per share. The comparison relationship is evident because the second sentence offers a point of reference (1988 earnings) against which the potential change in 1989 earnings can be compared. Specifically, it allows the reader to understand the magnitude of the potential earnings reduction relative to the previous year's earnings.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||But state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission 's rate increase and found the rates illegal .||The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission to audit Commonwealth Edison 's construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses .||In the first sentence, we learn that state courts supported a challenge by consumer groups against the commission's rate hike and ruled that the rates were unlawful. The second sentence details a specific order from the Illinois Supreme Court as a result of these court rulings: the commission must audit Commonwealth Edison's construction costs and return any unjustified expenses. This sentence expands on the consequences of the court's decision by specifying one of the actions taken following the determination that the rates were illegal.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||In August , the commission ruled that between $ 190 million and $ 195 million of the plant 's construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded , plus interest .||In his ruling , Judge Curry added an additional $ 55 million to the commission 's calculations .||The first sentence states that the commission decided a specific amount ($190 million to $195 million) of the plant's construction costs was unreasonable and should be refunded with interest. The second sentence expands on this by mentioning Judge Curry's ruling, which adds an extra $55 million to the refund. Thus, Judge Curry's action increases the total amount to be refunded, building upon the initial decision made by the commission. This expansion of the initial information establishes the Expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||In his ruling , Judge Curry added an additional $ 55 million to the commission 's calculations .||Last month , Judge Curry set the interest rate on the refund at 9 % .||The first sentence states that Judge Curry added an extra $55 million to the commission's calculations.In the second sentence, it is mentioned that Judge Curry previously established the interest rate on the refund at 9%.Both actions are performed by Judge Curry and relate to financial aspects of the case. The second sentence expands on Judge Curry's role by providing additional context about his previous decision regarding the interest rate, thus expanding our understanding of his involvement in the case.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||And consumer groups hope that Judge Curry 's Byron 1 order may set a precedent for a second nuclear rate case involving Commonwealth Edison 's Braidwood 2 plant .||Commonwealth Edison is seeking about $ 245 million in rate increases to pay for Braidwood 2 .||The first sentence indicates that consumer groups are hoping Judge Curry's decision on Byron 1 could set a precedent for another case involving Commonwealth Edison and the Braidwood 2 plant. The second sentence provides context by explaining what Commonwealth Edison is seeking in relation to Braidwood 2, specifically, a rate increase to cover costs. The contingency relationship is demonstrated because the hopes of the consumer groups for setting a precedent (first sentence) depend on the situation with Commonwealth Edison's request for rate increases (second sentence). The potential precedent is contingent upon the details of Commonwealth Edison's case and what they are seeking.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The strong growth followed year-to-year increases of 21 % in August and 12 % in September .||The monthly sales have been setting records every month since March .||The first sentence states specific year-to-year increases in sales for August and September, quantifying the growth.The second sentence generalizes this trend, stating that monthly sales have been setting records every month since March. The expansion relationship is demonstrated through the transition from specific figures in August and September to a broader claim about continuous record-breaking sales since March. The general statement encompasses and builds upon the specific data points provided earlier.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Sales of passenger cars grew 22 % from a year earlier to 361,376 units .||Sales of medium-sized cars , , more than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 in October 1988 .||The first sentence states that sales of passenger cars increased by 22% from a year earlier to reach 361,376 units. This provides a broad context of growth in passenger car sales.The second sentence specifically mentions that sales of medium-sized cars more than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 units in October 1988. This detail elaborates on a particular segment within the broader category of passenger cars, showing a more significant increase for medium-sized cars.The relationship of expansion indicates that the detailed information about medium-sized car sales supplements and expands upon the general information about passenger car sales, providing a more precise view of the growth within a specific subset of passenger cars.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Not only is development of the new company 's initial machine tied directly to Mr. Cray , so is its balance sheet .||that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $ 100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped||The first sentence states that both the development of the new company's initial machine and its balance sheet are tied directly to Mr. Cray. The second sentence expands on this by providing a specific scenario that illustrates the extent of Mr. Cray's influence: Cray Research Inc. will withdraw significant funding if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project he leads is canceled. This detail further explains how Mr. Cray's role affects the financial stability of the new firm, supporting the expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||and without him it could not be completed||Cray Research did not want to fund a project that did not include Seymour . ''||The first sentence states that the project cannot be completed without the mentioned individual, indicating his importance.The second sentence tells us that Cray Research was unwilling to fund the project if Seymour was not part of it. The decision of Cray Research (not funding the project without Seymour) is contingent upon the necessity of having Seymour involved, as expressed in the first sentence. This establishes a contingent relationship between the two sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||that Cray Research 's decision to link its $ 98.3 million promissory note to Mr. Cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company||It has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor||The first sentence states that Cray Research linking its promissory note to Mr. Cray's presence will complicate the valuation of the new company. The second sentence adds more detail about this situation by specifying that this complication represents an additional risk for investors. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence builds upon the information provided in the first sentence, explaining further implications of the linkage.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||It has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor||Cray Computer will be a concept stock||The first sentence indicates that there is an additional risk for the investor.The second sentence provides information that Cray Computer will be a concept stock. The relationship is contingent because the characterization of Cray Computer as a concept stock can introduce uncertainties and risks that the investor must consider. Therefore, the status of Cray Computer as a concept stock creates an additional risk for the investor, linking the two sentences in a contingent manner.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Cray Computer will be a concept stock||`` You either believe Seymour can do it again or you do n't . ''||The first sentence states that Cray Computer will be a concept stock. The second sentence presents a condition related to investing in the company, based on belief in Seymour's capabilities. The contingency relationship here is that the value or appeal of Cray Computer as a concept stock is contingent on one's belief in Seymour's ability to succeed again. Essentially, whether Cray Computer is considered a good investment depends on the investor's faith in Seymour.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||Analysts calculate Cray Computer 's initial book value at about $ 4.75 a share .||Along with the note , Cray Research is transferring about $ 53 million in assets , primarily those related to the Cray-3 development , .||The first sentence states that analysts have calculated Cray Computer's initial book value per share. The second sentence provides more detail about what Cray Research is transferring, including specific assets like $53 million and mentioning the Cray-3 development. This additional information expands on the context of the book value calculation, indicating where some of the value comes from (i.e., the assets being transferred). Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information provided in the first one by giving more details about the assets contributing to the book value.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Pro-forma balance sheets clearly show why Cray Research favored the spinoff .||Without the Cray-3 research and development expenses , the company would have been able to report a profit of $ 19.3 million for the first half of 1989 rather than the $ 5.9 million it posted .||The first sentence states that pro-forma balance sheets demonstrate why Cray Research preferred the spinoff. The second sentence provides specific financial details to support this preference: without the expenses related to Cray-3 R&D, the company would have reported a significantly higher profit for the first half of 1989. This detail expands on the initial claim by showing how the financial situation improved in the hypothetical scenario, thus explaining one reason for the spinoff. The second sentence offers additional information that directly supports and expands upon the idea presented in the first sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Regarded as the father of the supercomputer , Mr. Cray was paid $ 600,000 at Cray Research last year .||At Cray Computer , he will be paid $ 240,000 .||The first sentence provides information about Mr. Cray's salary at Cray Research, which was $600,000.The second sentence states that at Cray Computer, his salary will be $240,000. The comparison relationship is evident because the two sentences are contrasting Mr. Cray's salaries at two different companies, highlighting the difference in amounts.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||However , five other countries -- China , Thailand , India , Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review||Under the new U.S. trade law , those countries could face accelerated unfair-trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they do n't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring .||The first sentence states that five countries will remain on the priority watch list due to an interim review. The second sentence explains what could happen to these countries under the new U.S. trade law if they do not improve their protection of intellectual property. The potential consequences (accelerated unfair-trade investigations and trade sanctions) are contingent upon the countries' actions (or lack thereof) regarding intellectual property protection. If the countries do not improve, then the outlined consequences may follow. This establishes a contingency relationship, where the future actions (consequences) depend on the current state or actions of the countries.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||many of the 25 countries that she placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made `` genuine progress '' on this touchy issue||there is `` growing realization '' around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms all trading nations ,||The first sentence states that many of the 25 countries reviewed have made "genuine progress" on the issue of intellectual property rights. The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining that there is a "growing realization" worldwide that denying these rights harms all trading nations. The expansion is evident in the further elaboration of why the progress is happening (due to the growing understanding of mutual harm), providing additional context for the progress mentioned in the first sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||These three countries are n't completely off the hook , though .||They will remain on a lower-priority list that includes 17 other countries .||The first sentence indicates that the three countries mentioned still face some consequences or continued attention, albeit not as severe as being "completely off the hook." The second sentence specifies that these countries will be placed on a lower-priority list with 17 others. The comparison relationship is evident through the contrast in the level of priority or consequence: the countries are not fully absolved but are also not at the highest level of concern. Instead, they are compared to a group of lesser concern, indicating a middle ground in terms of priority or scrutiny.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||They will remain on a lower-priority list that includes 17 other countries .||Those countries -- including Japan , Italy , Canada , Greece and Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed to pose less-serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the `` priority '' list .||The first sentence states that certain countries will remain on a lower-priority list. The second sentence explains why these countries are on the lower-priority list by describing their status relative to the "priority" list countries. The contingency relationship is established because the reason (less serious problems for American patent and copyright owners) justifies the situation described in the first sentence (remaining on the lower-priority list). The status of these countries is contingent upon their impact on American intellectual property interests.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||the threat of U.S. retaliation , combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest , prompted the improvements made by South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia||What this tells us is that U.S. trade law is working||The first sentence explains the factors leading to improvements made by South Korea, Taiwan, and Saudi Arabia regarding intellectual property protection: the threat of U.S. retaliation and the recognition of self-interest. The second sentence expands on this by stating that these outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of U.S. trade law. It provides additional insight into the implications of the actions taken by these countries, suggesting that they are a positive outcome of U.S. policy. The expansion comes from the connection drawn between the improvements and the success of U.S. trade law.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||What this tells us is that U.S. trade law is working||Mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law||The first sentence asserts that U.S. trade law is effective because countries are taking actions to comply with it, implying positive changes in those countries' policies. The second sentence provides a specific example of this effectiveness: Mexico may be removed from the priority list due to its work on a new patent law. This detail expands on the initial claim by illustrating how the law has influenced Mexico's policy-making process. Thus, the second sentence serves as an expansion of the idea introduced in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Mrs. Hills said that the U.S. is still concerned about `` disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia . ''||although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey||The first sentence states that Mrs. Hills expressed ongoing U.S. concerns regarding developments in Turkey and slow progress in Malaysia. The second sentence provides specific examples of the issues mentioned in the first sentence, detailing the nature of the problems in each country (videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey). These details expand upon the initial statement of concern, explaining what exactly the "disturbing developments" and "slow progress" refer to. Therefore, the second sentence serves to expand on the information presented in the first sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||But the new 1977 PCs -- unlike earlier built-from-kit types such as the Altair , Sol and IMSAI -- had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories .||Current PCs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than their 1977 counterparts .||The first sentence describes the features of new 1977 PCs, noting they differed from earlier models by having keyboards and a specific memory capacity. The second sentence compares current PCs to those from 1977, stating they are significantly faster and have much larger memory capacities. The relationship is one of comparison, as the second sentence contrasts the capabilities of current PCs with those of the 1977 models, highlighting advancements over time.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||There were many pioneer PC contributors .||William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language-housekeeper system for PCs||The first sentence mentions there were many pioneer contributors to the development of PCs, but does not specify who they are. The second sentence provides more specific information by naming William Gates and Paul Allen as contributors and detailing their work in 1975 on an early language-housekeeper system for PCs. This detail expands upon the initial statement about pioneer contributors, giving specific examples and context. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language-housekeeper system for PCs , and Gates became an industry billionaire six years after IBM adapted one of these versions in 1981 .||Alan F. Shugart , currently chairman of Seagate Technology , led the team that developed the disk drives for PCs .||The first sentence introduces the topic of early developments in PC technology, specifically mentioning the creation of a language-housekeeper system by William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, and the success of Gates after IBM adopted a version of this system in 1981. The second sentence provides additional information about the development of disk drives for PCs, mentioning Alan F. Shugart's role in leading the team that developed these drives. This additional detail expands on the context of early PC technology development mentioned in the first sentence, contributing to a broader understanding of the early PC ecosystem.

Alan F. Shugart , currently chairman of Seagate Technology , led the team that developed the disk drives for PCs .||Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington , two Atlanta engineers , were co-developers of the internal modems that allow PCs to share data via the telephone .||The first sentence introduces the topic of key contributors to the development of personal computer technology, specifically mentioning William Gates, Paul Allen, and Alan F. Shugart and their contributions.The second sentence expands on this topic by introducing additional contributors, Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington, who developed internal modems for PCs. Both sentences focus on individuals who played significant roles in advancing PC technology, but the second sentence broadens the scope by adding more figures and their specific contributions to the narrative. This expansion enriches the understanding of various aspects of PC technology development.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||it owns 33 % of Moleculon 's voting stock and has an agreement to acquire an additional 19 %||That stake , together with its convertible preferred stock holdings , gives Faulding the right to increase its interest to 70 % of Moleculon 's voting stock .||The first sentence outlines Faulding's current ownership (33% of Moleculon's voting stock) and an agreement to acquire more (an additional 19%). The second sentence explains the outcome of these actions: the right to increase its interest to 70% of Moleculon's voting stock, including its convertible preferred stock holdings. The right to increase its interest to 70% is contingent upon the initial ownership and the agreement to acquire more stock.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Alternative', 'instead'] ||Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches , covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications .||Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories ,||The first sentence states that Timex requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches, covering 58 different U.S. tariff classifications. The second sentence provides more specific information about the request by mentioning that Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories. This additional detail expands upon the initial statement by specifying how many categories were approved out of the total requested. Therefore, the second sentence has an expansion relationship with the first sentence, offering more precise information about the outcome of the request.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||An ambitious expansion has left Magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn .||The company has reported declines in operating profit in each of the past three years , despite steady sales growth .||The first sentence states that Magna underwent an ambitious expansion, which resulted in excess capacity and heavy debt during a downturn in the automotive industry. The second sentence mentions that despite steady sales growth, the company has seen declines in operating profit over the past three years. The expansion mentioned in the first sentence is directly related to the financial outcomes in the second sentence. Specifically, the excess capacity and heavy debt from the expansion likely contributed to the decline in operating profit, even as sales grew. This connection between the expansion and its financial consequences illustrates an expansion relationship between the two sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||the company 's Class A shares are wallowing far below their 52-week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars US$ 13.73||On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday , Magna shares closed up 37.5 Canadian cents to C$ 9.625 .||The first sentence states that the company's Class A shares are currently trading significantly lower than their 52-week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars (US$ 13.73). The second sentence provides more specific information about the current status of the shares: they closed at 9.625 Canadian dollars on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which is indeed "wallowing" below the 52-week high, and also details a minor increase of 37.5 Canadian cents. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more detail about the current share price and its slight rise, reinforcing the notion that the shares are still below their 52-week high.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage-based instruments||more than 90 % of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors||The first sentence states that purchases demonstrate the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage-based instruments. The second sentence further clarifies this point by specifying that over 90% of the funds were allocated to Japanese institutional investors. The second sentence expands on the initial claim by providing specific details about the extent of Japanese investment, thus deepening our understanding of the level of interest from Japanese investors.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||more than 90 % of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors||The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong .||The first sentence states that over 90% of the funds were allocated to Japanese institutional investors. The second sentence expands on the distribution of the remaining funds, specifying that they were given to investors from France and Hong Kong. The second sentence provides additional information about the allocation of the funds beyond what was stated in the first sentence, hence the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Japan 's reserves of gold , convertible foreign currencies , and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $ 1.82 billion in October to $ 84.29 billion||The total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline .||The first sentence states that Japan's reserves of gold, convertible foreign currencies, and special drawing rights fell by $1.82 billion in October to $84.29 billion. The second sentence provides additional information about this decline, specifying that it is part of a six-month consecutive trend. The second sentence expands on the first by giving context about the duration of the decline, thus deepening our understanding of the financial situation described in the first sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular||They fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash .||The first sentence describes the popularity of narrowly focused funds at a certain point in time. The second sentence discusses their decline after the 1929 crash. The comparison relationship is established through contrasting the success of these funds before the crash with their downfall afterward. Specifically, the shift from being "wildly popular" to falling "into oblivion" highlights the change in their status, making the relationship comparative.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Behind all the hoopla is some heavy-duty competition .||As individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years , securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell .||The first sentence indicates there is significant competition behind the surface excitement. The second sentence explains one reason for this competition: with individual investors turning away from the stock market, securities firms need to find new products to maintain sales. Thus, the need for new products (second sentence) is contingent upon the shift in investor behavior (first sentence). The firms' scramble to find new products is a direct response to the changing market conditions, illustrating a contingent relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||But it does n't take much to get burned .||Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds .||The first sentence states that "it doesn't take much to get burned," suggesting that one can easily suffer losses or negative consequences. The second sentence elaborates on this idea by providing a specific context: political and currency fluctuations can cause sudden, severe changes in the value of funds. This sentence expands on the idea of being easily harmed or affected by detailing particular circumstances (political and currency gyrations) that can lead to swift and significant impacts (whipsawing of funds). Thus, the second sentence serves to expand upon the general warning of the first sentence by providing more specific examples of how harm can occur.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios||After trading at an average discount of more than 20 % in late 1987 and part of last year , country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6 % .||The first sentence states that many investments are trading at historically high premiums relative to the value of their underlying portfolios. The second sentence provides specific details about this situation by mentioning the shift from an average discount of over 20% in late 1987 and part of the previous year to an average premium of 6% now. This detailed information expands upon the initial statement about trading at high premiums, offering concrete examples and historical context. Thus, the second sentence expands the first one.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||But some European funds recently have skyrocketed||Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120 % premium||The first sentence states that some European funds have recently experienced significant increases. The second sentence provides specific information about one of those funds, the Spain Fund, and its surge to a 120% premium. The second sentence expands on the general statement made in the first sentence by providing a detailed example of a fund that has experienced the mentioned increase. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120 % premium||It has been targeted by Japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to 1992 's European economic integration .||The first sentence indicates that the Spain Fund has risen significantly to a 120% premium.The second sentence provides a possible reason for this surge: the fund has been targeted by Japanese investors due to its connection with European economic integration in 1992. This suggests that the increase in the fund's value is contingent upon its attractiveness to Japanese investors as a result of the upcoming economic integration. The contingency relationship is established by linking the fund's performance to the actions of Japanese investors.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds||Unlike many U.S. investors , those in Asia or Europe seeking foreign-stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds .||The first sentence indicates that the premiums for country funds have increased due to global marketing efforts. The second sentence discusses a group of investors (those in Asia or Europe) who might be more accepting of these higher prices. The contingency relationship is evident because the willingness of these international investors to pay higher prices is contingent upon their differing attitudes compared to U.S. investors, as suggested in the context. The behavior of these specific investors is dependent on their perspective, which contrasts with the implied resistance of U.S. investors.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch||The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved last spring and opened in July .||The first sentence states that a Soviet bank has been allowed to open a branch in New York. The second sentence provides additional details about the same event: it identifies the specific bank (Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs), mentions when it was approved (last spring), and notes when it opened (in July). The second sentence expands on the information given in the first sentence by providing more specific details, hence the expansion relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund||The U.S.S.R. belongs to neither organization .||The first sentence sets a condition for being a member of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.The second sentence provides information about the U.S.S.R.'s status in relation to these organizations, specifying that it does not belong to either one. The comparison relationship is established through contrasting the unspecified "they" in the first sentence with the known status of the U.S.S.R. in the second sentence, highlighting the U.S.S.R.'s non-membership in these organizations.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month||Its index inched up to 47.6 % in October from 46 % in September .||The first sentence states that the manufacturing economy contracted for the sixth consecutive month in October based on the latest survey. The second sentence provides more specific information about the index that measures this contraction, indicating that it increased to 47.6% in October from 46% in September. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence broadens the understanding of the first by adding quantitative detail (the index values) to the qualitative statement (the contraction). The increase in the index value itself does not indicate economic expansion but rather a lessening degree of contraction, which aligns with providing more detailed information about the contraction mentioned.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Its index inched up to 47.6 % in October from 46 % in September .||Any reading below 50 % suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining .||The first sentence provides data about an index increasing from 46% in September to 47.6% in October.The second sentence explains that any reading under 50% indicates a decline in the manufacturing sector. These sentences form a comparison as they relate the numerical values in the first sentence to the contextual meaning provided in the second sentence, comparing the specific percentage values to the broader criterion for assessing the health of the manufacturing sector.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Factories booked $ 236.74 billion in orders in September , nearly the same as the $ 236.79 billion in August||If not for a 59.6 % surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors , factory orders would have fallen 2.1 % .||The first sentence states that factories received $236.74 billion in orders in September, almost equal to the $236.79 billion in August. The second sentence provides additional detail about the composition of those orders, specifically mentioning a significant surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors, which prevented a decline in overall factory orders. This additional information expands our understanding of the factors influencing the stability in order volume between August and September, hence the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ 415.6 billion , not significantly different from the $ 415.8 billion reported for August||Private construction spending was down , but government building activity was up .||The first sentence states that the overall construction spending was at an annual rate of $415.6 billion, which is very similar to the $415.8 billion reported for August, suggesting no significant change in total construction spending. The second sentence provides additional detail by breaking down the components of construction spending: private construction spending was down, while government building activity increased.The expansion relationship is demonstrated through the additional information provided in the second sentence that expands on the initial statement. By explaining the components of the overall spending, we learn why there was no significant difference in total construction spending (due to the offsetting changes in private and public sectors).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||By most measures , the nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all .||Factory payrolls fell in September .||The first sentence states that the growth of the nation's industrial sector is very slow or possibly non-existent. The second sentence adds more detail to the condition of the industrial sector by providing specific evidence of decline: factory payrolls fell in September. This additional information expands on the original point about slow growth, thus establishing an expansion relationship between the two sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Factory payrolls fell in September .||So did the Federal Reserve Board 's industrial-production index .||The first sentence states that factory payrolls decreased in September. The second sentence reports a decrease in the Federal Reserve Board's industrial-production index. Both sentences describe declines in related economic indicators (factory payrolls and industrial production). Since both events (decreases in factory payrolls and industrial production) are happening simultaneously and are related, the second sentence expands on the initial information by providing additional context about the broader economic situation, specifically the decline in industrial production, which is likely connected to the decrease in factory payrolls.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession .||They cite a lack of `` imbalances '' that provide early warning signals of a downturn .||The first sentence states that many economists aren't predicting an imminent recession. The second sentence explains why they hold this view by citing a specific reason: a lack of "imbalances" that typically signal an upcoming downturn. This additional information expands on the initial statement by providing a rationale for the economists' predictions, hence the expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Inventories are closely watched for such clues , for instance .||a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession||The first sentence indicates that inventories are closely monitored for certain indications or insights.The second sentence explains one of the reasons why this monitoring is crucial: a buildup in inventories can trigger production cutbacks that may result in a recession. This shows that the monitoring of inventories (first sentence) is contingent upon understanding the potential consequences, like the risk of recession due to inventory buildups and subsequent production cutbacks (second sentence). The relationship is contingent because the action of closely watching inventories depends on recognizing the implications of changes in inventory levels.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||This conforms to the ` soft landing ' scenario||`` I do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive . ''||The first sentence states that the situation aligns with the 'soft landing' scenario, which implies a gentle economic slowdown rather than a sharp downturn. The second sentence provides a specific reason supporting the idea of a 'soft landing': there are no indications of excessive inventories, suggesting that supply and demand are relatively balanced. The second sentence expands on the first by offering a detail that helps explain why the scenario is considered a 'soft landing'.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||orders for nondurable goods -- those intended to last fewer than three years -- fell 0.3 % in September to $ 109.73 billion after climbing 0.9 % the month before||Orders for durable goods were up 0.2 % to $ 127.03 billion after rising 3.9 % the month before .||The first sentence provides information about the decrease in orders for nondurable goods in September, while the second sentence discusses the increase in orders for durable goods in the same period. The comparison relationship is evident as both sentences present data for different types of goods (nondurable vs. durable) for the same time frame (September), allowing readers to contrast the performance of each category. By providing percentage changes and values for both nondurable and durable goods, the text enables a direct comparison between the two categories.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Factory shipments fell 1.6 % to $ 234.4 billion after rising 5.4 % in August .||Shipments have been relatively level since January||The first sentence indicates a specific decrease in factory shipments following an increase in the previous month. The second sentence provides context about the overall trend in shipments over a longer period, stating they have been relatively level since January. The comparison relationship is established through contrasting the specific fluctuation mentioned in the first sentence with the broader trend of stability described in the second sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5 % in September to $ 497.34 billion , .||Excluding these orders , backlogs declined 0.3 % .||The first sentence states that manufacturers' backlogs of unfilled orders increased by 0.5% in September to reach $497.34 billion. The second sentence provides a different scenario by excluding certain orders, noting that backlogs then declined by 0.3%. These sentences establish a comparison by presenting the change in backlogs under two conditions: with all orders included and with some orders excluded. This comparison highlights how the inclusion or exclusion of specific orders affects the overall backlog figures.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||residential construction , , was off 0.9 % in September to an annual rate of $ 191.9 billion||the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes , but probably not until early next year||The first sentence indicates a decrease in residential construction in September to a specific annual rate. The second sentence discusses the future impact of dropping interest rates on spending for single-family homes, predicting a positive effect but with a delay until early next year. The comparison relationship is established through the contrast between the current decline in residential construction and the anticipated future increase in spending due to lower interest rates. The sentences compare the immediate downturn with the expected eventual upturn in the relevant market conditions.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Spending on private , nonresidential construction was off 2.6 % to an annual rate of $ 99.1 billion with no sector showing strength .||Government construction spending rose 4.3 % to $ 88 billion .||The first sentence indicates a decrease in spending on private, nonresidential construction, mentioning a specific percentage drop and the lack of strength in any sector. The second sentence reports an increase in government construction spending, including its percentage rise and the total amount spent. These sentences form a comparison by contrasting the decline in private construction spending with the increase in government construction spending, highlighting different trends in related sectors.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The government 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by McGraw-Hill Inc. 's F.W. Dodge Group .||Dodge reported an 8 % increase in construction contracts awarded in September .||The first sentence indicates there is a contrast between the government's construction spending figures and a report from the F.W. Dodge Group. The second sentence details what the F.W. Dodge Group reported, specifically an 8% increase in construction contracts awarded in September. The contingency relationship exists because the content of the F.W. Dodge Group's report (an 8% increase) is being contrasted with the government's construction spending figures, implying that the government’s data presents a different view on construction activity. The report by F.W. Dodge Group is contingent upon the context set by the mention of the contrasting government figures.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The goverment counts money as it is spent||Dodge counts contracts when they are awarded||The first sentence explains how the government tracks expenditure by counting the money as it is spent. The second sentence describes Dodge's method of tracking by counting contracts when they are awarded. Both actions involve a similar process of tracking at the moment of occurrence (spending or awarding). This parallelism establishes a comparison between the two methods, highlighting their similarity in timing and nature.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The government includes money spent on residential renovation||Dodge does n't||The first sentence states that the government includes money spent on residential renovation in its consideration or reporting.The second sentence states that Dodge does not include such spending. The comparison relationship is established through contrasting the inclusion of residential renovation spending by the government with its exclusion by Dodge. This directly compares how both entities handle the accounting of residential renovation costs.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Pragmatic cause', 'since'] ||Although the purchasing managers ' index continues to indicate a slowing economy , it is n't signaling an imminent recession||the index would have to be in the low 40 % range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession||The first sentence states that the purchasing managers' index indicates a slowing economy but not an imminent recession. The second sentence explains what would need to happen for the index to signal a recession: it would have to be in the low 40% range for several months. The contingency relationship is established because the second sentence presents a condition (the index being in the low 40% range for several months) that must be met for the index to forecast a recession. This condition is contingent upon the behavior of the index over time.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The report offered new evidence that the nation 's export growth , though still continuing , may be slowing .||Only 19 % of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October , down from 27 % in September .||The first sentence states that there is new evidence suggesting that the nation's export growth, while ongoing, might be decelerating. The second sentence provides specific data supporting this claim: only 19% of purchasing managers reported improved export orders in October, a decrease from 27% in September. This statistical detail directly expands upon the initial statement by offering concrete evidence for the slowing export growth. Therefore, the second sentence has an expansion relationship with the first one, as it adds more specific information to substantiate the claim made in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The purhasing managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control .||For the fifth consecutive month , purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell .||The first sentence states that the purchasing managers' report provided evidence that inflation is under control. The second sentence further elaborates on this point by specifying that for five consecutive months, purchasing managers reported a decline in the prices of the goods they purchased. This additional detail supports and expands upon the initial claim that inflation is under control, providing more context and evidence for the assertion. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information presented in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||For the fifth consecutive month , purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell .||The decline was even steeper than in September .||The first sentence states that purchasing managers reported falling prices for the goods they bought for five months in a row. The second sentence adds more detail about the decline, specifying that it was even steeper than in September. This additional information expands upon the initial statement by providing a comparison to the previous month, thus deepening our understanding of the trend. The relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, as the second sentence broadens the context of the price decline mentioned in the first.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating .||When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen , prices tend to rise .||The first sentence states that economists interpret a certain sign as an indication that inflationary pressures are decreasing.The second sentence explains a scenario where prices tend to rise when demand exceeds supply and delivery times get longer. The contingency relationship is evident because the second sentence provides context for understanding why the sign mentioned in the first sentence would indicate a reduction in inflationary pressures. Specifically, if delivery times aren't lengthening and there isn't excessive demand, then the conditions that typically lead to rising prices (and potentially higher inflation) are not present. Thus, the absence of these conditions is contingent upon the sign that suggests inflationary pressures are abating.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The purchasing managers ' report is based on data provided by more than 250 purchasing executives .||Each of the survey 's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening .||The first sentence introduces the purchasing managers' report and mentions that it is based on data from over 250 purchasing executives. The second sentence explains how the survey's indicators are calculated, specifically detailing the method used to gauge changes reported by the purchasing executives. The second sentence expands on the information presented in the first sentence by providing more detail about how the data from the purchasing executives is utilized to create the report's indicators.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||It found that of the 73 % who import , 10 % said they imported more in October and 12 % said they imported less than the previous month .||It does lead you to suspect imports are going down , or at least not increasing that much||The first sentence presents data about import activity, specifically noting that a portion of importers either increased or decreased their imports in October compared to the previous month. The second sentence offers an interpretation or suspicion based on this data: that imports may be decreasing or not increasing significantly. The suspicion arises from the information provided, indicating that the second sentence is contingent upon the first. The suspicion (imports not increasing much) is a consequence or inference drawn from the presented data (percentage of importers changing their import levels).
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'however'] ||It 's an odd thing to put on the list||that for the second month in a row , food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk||The sentence makes a comparison by stating that it's odd to include "that for the second month in a row, food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk" on the list. This implies that the item is unusual or unexpected for inclusion, setting up a contrast between what is typically on the list and this particular entry. The comparison highlights the peculiarity of the situation regarding the repeated shortage of nonfat dry milk.

Goode '' and watch Bugs Bunny reruns .||They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo .||The first sentence describes actions and details (drinking Salty Dogs, whistling "Johnny B. Goode," watching Bugs Bunny reruns) that set a particular scene or context.The second sentence provides additional actions and references (reading Mickey Spillane, talking about Groucho and Harpo) that further establish the setting or atmosphere. Both sentences contribute to building a cohesive picture of the environment or culture being described, with each sentence expanding upon the other in terms of providing more elements that characterize the scene. Therefore, the relationship is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds to the description started in the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.List', 'and'] ||Characters drink Salty Dogs , whistle `` Johnny B. Goode '' and watch Bugs Bunny reruns . They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo .||They worry about their careers , drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs .||The first sentence describes activities and interests of the characters, such as drinking Salty Dogs, whistling "Johnny B. Goode," watching Bugs Bunny reruns, reading Mickey Spillane, and discussing Groucho and Harpo. These details establish a cultural context and setting for the characters. The second sentence delves deeper into the personal lives of the characters, mentioning their career worries, excessive drinking, and troubled relationships. This additional information expands upon the initial depiction of the characters' lives, providing a more comprehensive understanding of their circumstances and emotional states. Therefore, the second sentence serves as an expansion of the first by adding depth to the characters' experiences and challenges.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||Characters drink Salty Dogs , whistle `` Johnny B. Goode '' and watch Bugs Bunny reruns . They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo . They worry about their careers , drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs .||This is Japan ?||The first sentence describes the characters' activities and interests, such as drinking Salty Dogs, whistling "Johnny B. Goode," watching Bugs Bunny reruns, reading Mickey Spillane, and discussing Groucho and Harpo. It also mentions their concerns about their careers and personal lives. The second sentence expresses surprise that these behaviors and concerns are occurring in Japan. The contingency relationship is established because the second sentence questions the context or setting of the first sentence, suggesting that the activities and worries described might not be expected or commonly associated with Japan. The surprise or questioning of the setting is contingent upon the description of the characters' actions and concerns.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||It 's also refreshing to read a Japanese author who clearly does n't belong to the self-aggrandizing `` we-Japanese '' school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese , unfathomable by outsiders .||If `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' carries an implicit message for international relations , it 's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think .||The first sentence criticizes a group of Japanese authors who promote the idea of uniquely incomprehensible Japanese culture and identity. The second sentence suggests that "A Wild Sheep Chase" conveys the opposite message, indicating that the Japanese are more similar to others than commonly believed. These two sentences form a comparison by contrasting the views of the criticized authors with the message of the book "A Wild Sheep Chase," which argues for shared commonalities rather than emphasizing differences.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||That 's not to say that the nutty plot of `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' is rooted in reality .||It 's imaginative and often funny .||The first sentence states that the plot of "A Wild Sheep Chase" is not rooted in reality, implying that it has fantastical or imaginative elements. The second sentence directly describes the plot as imaginative and often funny. The comparison relationship is established through the shared characteristic of imagination between the two sentences: both indicate that the plot is imaginative, with the second sentence adding a positive evaluation (funny). This comparison highlights the nature of the book's plot and its appeal.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||It 's imaginative and often funny .||A disaffected , hard-drinking , nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a Stanford degree .||The first sentence provides an overall positive evaluation of something, suggesting it is imaginative and often funny.The second sentence offers specific details about the plot or premise, describing the protagonist, his mission, and the antagonist.These details expand on the initial positive assessment by providing examples of what makes the story imaginative and humorous. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving concrete examples that support the claim of imagination and humor.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||A disaffected , hard-drinking , nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a Stanford degree .||He has in tow his prescient girlfriend , whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly .||The first sentence introduces the main character and outlines his mission to find a specific sheep, prompted by a mobster. It also mentions that he is accompanied by his girlfriend. The second sentence expands on the character of the girlfriend by providing more detail about her personality and behavior (her prescience and sassy retorts). Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information provided in the first one, specifically enhancing the description of the girlfriend who was mentioned in the initial sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||A disaffected , hard-drinking , nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a Stanford degree . He has in tow his prescient girlfriend , whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly .||Along the way , he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who offers the hero God 's phone number ; .||The first sentence introduces the main character and his mission to find a specific sheep, along with other characters like his girlfriend and the mobster.

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||In Robert Whiting 's `` You Gotta Have Wa '' Macmillan , 339 pages , $ 17.95 , the Beatles give way to baseball , in the Nipponese version we would be hard put to call a `` game . ''||, Nipponese baseball is a `` mirror of Japan 's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . ''||The first sentence introduces the book "You Gotta Have Wa" by Robert Whiting and provides some details about it, including a description of Nipponese (Japanese) baseball as something difficult to label as a "game".The second sentence explains why Japanese baseball may be described in this way: it mirrors Japan's values of hard work and harmony. This explanation is contingent upon the initial characterization of the sport, providing a reason for the unusual description. The second sentence is providing additional context or clarification for the first, explaining the nature of Japanese baseball in relation to cultural values.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||, Nipponese baseball is a `` mirror of Japan 's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . ''||`` Wa '' is Japanese for `` team spirit '' and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it .||The first sentence states that Nipponese (Japanese) baseball reflects Japan's virtues of hard work and harmony. The second sentence introduces "Wa," a term meaning "team spirit" in Japanese, and asserts that Japanese ballplayers possess a lot of it. The second sentence expands on the idea of harmony introduced in the first sentence by providing more detail about the specific virtue of team spirit ("Wa") that Japanese ballplayers embody.

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||`` Wa '' is Japanese for `` team spirit '' and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it .||A player 's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average .||The first sentence introduces the concept of "Wa", which is described as "team spirit" in Japanese culture, and asserts that Japanese ballplayers possess a lot of it. The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining how a player's commitment to practice and team image is valued as highly as their individual performance, specifically using the example of batting average. This further illustrates the significance of "Wa" in the context of Japanese baseball, providing additional detail on how team spirit manifests itself through players' dedication to the team beyond personal statistics.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.List', 'and'] ||Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers||the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter||The sentence about fans returning foul balls to stadium ushers does not provide information directly related to the mechanics or rules of the game that would affect the strike zone. The second part of the sentence, regarding the strike zone expanding depending on the size of the hitter, is a rule or characteristic of the game itself. There is no logical connection between fan behavior with foul balls and the dimensions of the strike zone. Thus, there is no direct expansion from the first part to the second part; they are separate observations about different aspects of the baseball experience.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.List', 'and'] ||Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ;||ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat||The first sentence outlines unusual rules or practices in this particular context (possibly a fictional or metaphorical game setting), such as returning foul balls and the variable strike zone. The second sentence introduces another unique rule: allowing and even appreciating ties. This rule is an additional or expanded practice within the same context, further emphasizing the distinct nature of this setting. Therefore, the second sentence expands upon the theme of unconventional rules introduced in the first sentence, making the relationship between the sentences one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.List', 'and'] ||Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ;||players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives||The first part of the sentence details unusual aspects of the game, such as fans returning foul balls, the variable strike zone, and the acceptance of ties. The latter part introduces another unique rule, that players must follow strict rules of conduct in their personal lives. This additional rule further elaborates on the game's emphasis on proper behavior, expanding the understanding of the game's culture and regulations. Thus, the relationship is one of expansion, where the latter part adds to the description of the game's rules and atmosphere.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||of how American ballplayers , rationed to two per team , fare in Japan||Despite the enormous sums of money they 're paid to stand up at a Japanese plate , a good number decide it 's not worth it and run for home .||The first sentence introduces the topic of American ballplayers who are limited to two per team in Japan.The second sentence expands on this topic by providing more details about the experiences of these players. Specifically, it mentions that despite being paid significant amounts of money, many of these players find the experience so challenging that they choose to leave. This additional information deepens our understanding of the initial statement about American ballplayers in Japan, thus creating an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||`` Funny Business '' Soho , 228 pages , $ 17.95 by Gary Katzenstein is anything but .||It 's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom Sony hosted for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo -- to the regret of both parties .||The first sentence introduces "Funny Business" by Gary Katzenstein, suggesting that despite its title, the book is not funny. The second sentence expands on this idea by providing context about the nature of the book and its content. Specifically, it explains that the book is a petulant complaint from the author, who was hosted by Sony during a fellowship in Tokyo, and that the experience led to mutual regret. This additional information deepens our understanding of why the book is described as "anything but" funny, hence forming an expansionary relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark .||It 's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity , , .||The first sentence states that some of the observations about the Japanese management style are accurate. The second sentence provides a specific example of one such observation: that many salarymen work unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity. This sentence expands upon the initial claim by offering a particular instance that supports the accuracy of the observations mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||It 's a shame their meeting never took place .||Mr. Katzenstein certainly would have learned something , and it 's even possible Mr. Morita would have too .||The first sentence expresses regret that a meeting did not occur.The second sentence discusses a potential outcome of this hypothetical meeting: both Mr. Katzenstein and possibly Mr. Morita learning something. This outcome is contingent upon the meeting happening. Since the meeting did not take place, the opportunity for them to learn from each other was lost, illustrating a contingency relationship between the sentences.

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||In Seoul , officials began visiting about 26,000 cigarette stalls to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes .||South Korea has opened its market to foreign cigarettes but restricts advertising to designated places .||The first sentence states that officials in Seoul started visiting cigarette stalls to remove illegal advertising materials for imported cigarettes.The second sentence explains that South Korea allows foreign cigarettes in its market but imposes restrictions on advertising these products to specific locations. The visits by officials and their actions to remove illegal advertising (first sentence) are contingent upon the advertising restrictions (second sentence). The restriction necessitates the enforcement action taken by the officials.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||The survey found that nearly half of Hong Kong consumers espouse what it identified as materialistic values , compared with about one-third in Japan and the U.S. .||More than three in five said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time , compared with less than one in two U.S. consumers and one in four in Japan .||The first sentence introduces the topic of comparing materialistic values among consumers in Hong Kong, Japan, and the U.S., stating that nearly half of Hong Kong consumers hold materialistic values, compared to about one-third in Japan and the U.S.The second sentence expands on the comparison by introducing another aspect: the level of stress experienced by consumers. It compares the percentage of people in each country who say they are under a great deal of stress most of the time. Since the second sentence adds more comparative information to the topic introduced in the first sentence, the relationship between the two sentences is Expansion.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'previously'] ||The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister Pramual Sabhavasu 's proposal to build a $ 19 million conference center for a joint meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund two years from now .||The meeting , , was going to be held at the Central Plaza Hotel , but the government balked at the hotel 's conditions for undertaking necessary expansion .||The first sentence states that the Thai cabinet approved a proposal to construct a conference center for a future World Bank and IMF meeting. The second sentence explains that the meeting was initially planned to be held at the Central Plaza Hotel, but the government had issues with the hotel's terms for expansion. The temporal relationship is evident here because the decision to build a new conference center (as mentioned in the first sentence) happened after the government encountered problems with the hotel's conditions (as stated in the second sentence). This sequence of events establishes the temporal connection between the two sentences.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'earlier'] ||Yasser Arafat has written to the chairman of the International Olympic Committee asking him to back a Palestinian bid to join the committee||the committee first applied for membership in 1979 and renewed its application in August of this year||The first sentence states that Yasser Arafat has written to the IOC chairman to support a Palestinian bid for membership. The second sentence provides background information on when the committee initially and most recently applied for membership. The temporal relationship is established by the sequence of events: the initial application in 1979, the recent renewal in August, and then Arafat's letter. This sequence places the events in chronological order, indicating a temporal connection.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||the committee first applied for membership in 1979 and renewed its application in August of this year||The PLO in recent months has been trying to join international organizations but failed earlier this year to win membership in the World Health Organization and the World Tourism Organization .||The first sentence states that the committee (implied to be the PLO from the context) applied for membership in 1979 and renewed its application recently. The second sentence expands on this information by explaining that the PLO's efforts to join international organizations also included applications to the World Health Organization and the World Tourism Organization, both of which were unsuccessful. This additional context provides more detail about the PLO's broader efforts to gain membership in various international bodies, which aligns with the initial mention of their membership application. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information provided in the first sentence.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||the man , whom it did not name , had been found to have the disease after hospital tests||Once the disease was confirmed , all the man 's associates and family were tested , but none have so far been found to have AIDS||The first sentence states that an unnamed man was found to have the disease following hospital tests. The second sentence describes actions taken after the confirmation of the disease: testing the man's associates and family.

['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||the increases were intended to bring unrealistically low energy charges into line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices||In happier news , South Korea , in establishing diplomatic ties with Poland yesterday , announced $ 450 million in loans to the financially strapped Warsaw government .||The first sentence discusses the rationale behind increases in energy charges, aiming to align costs with production and address rising coal prices. The second sentence shifts to a positive development, specifically South Korea establishing diplomatic relations with Poland and offering significant financial support. The comparison relationship here is implied through the juxtaposition of an issue related to economic challenges (energy cost adjustments) with a positive economic and diplomatic event (financial aid and diplomatic ties). The comparison highlights a contrast between addressing economic difficulties and receiving substantial financial assistance.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||it could seek $ 2 billion from Hungary if the twindam contract were broken||The Czech dam ca n't be operated solely at peak periods without the Nagymaros project .||The first sentence outlines a potential action (seeking $2 billion from Hungary) based on a specific condition (if the twindam contract were broken). The second sentence provides context about the interdependence of the Czech dam and the Nagymaros project, suggesting that breaking the twindam contract would have significant consequences for the operation of the Czech dam. Here, the potential financial action is contingent upon the status of the contract, which in turn affects the operational viability of the Czech dam. Thus, the relationship between the sentences is one of contingency, where the action depends on the state of the contract.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||As an actor , Charles Lane is n't the inheritor of Charlie Chaplin 's spirit .||Steve Martin has already laid his claim to that .||The first sentence states that Charles Lane is not the inheritor of Charlie Chaplin's spirit as an actor, suggesting he does not embody or continue Chaplin's style or essence in his performances.The second sentence introduces Steve Martin as someone who has already claimed that mantle, implying that he is considered to carry on Chaplin's legacy or style in his acting work. This establishes a comparison between Charles Lane and Steve Martin regarding who better embodies the spirit of Charlie Chaplin, with Steve Martin being positioned as the one who has successfully claimed that role.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||But it is Mr. Lane , as movie director , producer and writer , who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin 's Little Tramp in a contemporary way .||In 1976 , as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York , Mr. Lane shot `` A Place in Time , '' a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist , a man of the streets .||The first sentence states that Mr. Lane, as a movie director, producer, and writer, has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin's Little Tramp for a contemporary audience.The second sentence provides an example of Mr. Lane's work that aligns with this obsession: a 1976 film called "A Place in Time," which features a character (a sketch artist and man of the streets) that can be seen as a modern interpretation of the Little Tramp. The second sentence expands on the idea presented in the first sentence by providing specific evidence of Mr. Lane's efforts to update the Little Tramp for modern times.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||In 1976 , as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York , Mr. Lane shot `` A Place in Time , '' a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist , a man of the streets .||Now , 13 years later , Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called `` Sidewalk Stories , '' .||The first sentence provides information about Mr. Lane creating a short film titled "A Place in Time" while being a film student in 1976. The second sentence tells us that 13 years later, Mr. Lane created a full-length movie named "Sidewalk Stories," which is based on or continues the theme of the original short film's sketch artist character. This new movie expands upon the original concept from the short film, hence the relationship between the sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Of course , if the film contained dialogue , Mr. Lane 's Artist would be called a homeless person .||So would the Little Tramp , for that matter .||The first sentence states that if the film contained dialogue, Mr. Lane's character, the Artist, would be referred to as a homeless person. The second sentence adds another character, the Little Tramp, who would also be called a homeless person under the same condition. The second sentence expands the scope of the first sentence by including another character in the same hypothetical scenario, thus providing additional information to further illustrate the point made in the first sentence. This establishes an expansion relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||because `` Sidewalk Stories '' is n't really silent at all||Composer Marc Marder , a college friend of Mr. Lane 's , has prepared an exciting , eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles , or even words , would .||The first sentence states that "Sidewalk Stories" isn't truly silent, suggesting there's some form of audio component.The second sentence introduces a specific element of the film: a score composed by Marc Marder, which is described as conveying the thoughts and feelings of the characters more effectively than intertitles or words would.The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the effectiveness of the score with the traditional use of intertitles or words in silent films. The score is presented as a superior method for communicating the inner experiences of the characters, thereby enhancing the viewing experience beyond what one might expect from a silent film.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Much of Mr. Lane 's film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets .||Filmed in lovely black and white by Bill Dill , the New York streets of `` Sidewalk Stories '' seem benign .||The first sentence states that Mr. Lane's film presents a highly romanticized view of street life. The second sentence gives details about how this romanticization is visually achieved through the use of black and white cinematography by Bill Dill and the portrayal of New York streets as benign in "Sidewalk Stories." Thus, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by providing specific examples of how the romanticized view is presented in the film.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Filmed in lovely black and white by Bill Dill , the New York streets of `` Sidewalk Stories '' seem benign .||On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose , noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs .||The first sentence states that the New York streets in "Sidewalk Stories" appear benign due to being filmed in black and white by Bill Dill. The second sentence provides specific details about the behavior of people on Wall Street within the film, describing how they walk with purpose and only notice each other when they jostle for cabs. This detail expands upon the initial description of the streets as benign by offering a concrete example of life on those streets, illustrating what it means for the streets to seem benign in the context of the film.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose , noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs .||The Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village , on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers , magicians and other good-natured hustlers .||The first sentence describes the behavior of people on Wall Street, specifically noting how they interact with each other.The second sentence introduces "The Artist" and describes where they hang out, specifying a location on Sixth Avenue with various entertainers and characters.While the two sentences describe different groups of people and locations, the second sentence expands on the context of the first by providing additional information about the social environment in a nearby area. It adds detail to the setting by mentioning another part of the city (Greenwich Village) and the type of people found there, thereby enriching the overall picture of the urban landscape.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The Artist has his routine .||He spends his days sketching passers-by , or trying to .||The first sentence states that "The Artist" has his routine. The second sentence then provides specific details about what this routine entails: spending days sketching passers-by or attempting to do so. The second sentence expands upon the initial statement by giving more context and detail about the artist's routine, hence the relationship of expansion.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||He spends his days sketching passers-by , or trying to .||At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home .||The first sentence indicates the activity that "he" engages in during the day, which is sketching passers-by or attempting to do so. The second sentence describes what "he" does at night, specifically returning to the condemned building he calls home. The relationship is temporal because the actions described occur in sequence, with the daytime activity happening before the nighttime activity. This establishes a clear time order between the events.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||He spends his days sketching passers-by , or trying to . At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home .||His life , including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist , seems carefree .||The first sentence describes the daily activities of the subject: sketching passers-by during the day and returning to his living place at night. The second sentence provides additional context about his lifestyle, mentioning his interactions with a competing sketch artist and describing his overall life as carefree. The second sentence expands on the subject's lifestyle, providing more details about his experiences and character, hence forming an expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||This cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse .||She gives the Artist a sense of purpose , but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life .||The first sentence states that the cute child is both a blessing and a curse for the Artist. The second sentence then explains how this duality manifests: the child provides the Artist with a sense of purpose (blessing) but also makes him aware of the shortcomings of his vagrant lifestyle (curse). Thus, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, as it details the specific ways in which the child influences the Artist's life. The explanation for the contingency relationship lies in the fact that the second sentence directly responds to the assertion made in the first sentence by elaborating on the dual impact of the child on the Artist.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||She gives the Artist a sense of purpose , but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life .||The beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night .||The first sentence states that the Artist gains a sense of purpose from her, but she also makes him realize the problems with his current lifestyle. The second sentence provides a specific example of how his perspective changes: the beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night. This detail expands on the idea that having the little girl in his life highlights the inadequacies of his vagrant life, thus deepening our understanding of the impact she has on him.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Alternative', 'rather'] ||Mr. Lane 's final purpose is n't to glamorize the Artist 's vagabond existence .||He has a point he wants to make , and he makes it , with a great deal of force .||The first sentence indicates that Mr. Lane does not intend to glamorize the Artist's vagabond existence. The second sentence elaborates on this by stating that Mr. Lane has a specific point to make and delivers it forcefully. The expansion comes from providing additional information about Mr. Lane's intentions: not only does he not glamorize the existence, but he also has a strong, deliberate point to convey, which aligns with not glamorizing the lifestyle.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||The French film maker Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his `` Story of Women . ''||He has made a harsh , brilliant picture -- one that 's captivating -- about a character who , viewed from the most sympathetic angle , would seem disagreeable .||The first sentence states that Claude Chabrol achieved something unusual with "Story of Women." The second sentence explains what that unusual achievement is: creating a harsh yet brilliant and captivating film about a disagreeable character. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by providing details about the nature of the unusual achievement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||She became an abortionist accidentally , and continued because it enabled her to buy jam , cocoa and other war-rationed goodies .||She was untrained and , in one botched job killed a client .||The first sentence states that "She became an abortionist accidentally, and continued because it enabled her to buy jam, cocoa, and other war-rationed goodies." This introduces the subject and explains her motivation for continuing in this profession. The second sentence, "She was untrained and, in one botched job, killed a client," adds more detail about her qualifications and an incident that occurred during her work. It expands on the original statement by providing additional information about the character's lack of training and a negative outcome of her work. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence builds upon the information provided in the first.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||She was untrained and , in one botched job killed a client .||Her remorse was shallow and brief .||The first sentence states that the subject was untrained and, as a result of her lack of training, she accidentally killed a client during a botched job. The second sentence describes the subject's emotional state following the incident, noting that her remorse was not deep or long-lasting. These two sentences establish a comparison between the severity of the action (killing a client) and the relatively superficial and short-lived nature of her remorse. This comparison highlights the disparity between the gravity of the event and the subject's emotional response.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Her remorse was shallow and brief .||Although she was kind and playful to her children , she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband ; .||The first sentence states that "her remorse was shallow and brief." This suggests that any feelings of guilt or regret she had did not last long and were not deeply felt. The second sentence adds more context to her character by describing how she behaved toward different people in her life: she was kind and playful with her children but dreadful to her war-damaged husband. These additional details expand our understanding of her character and behavior, showing that while she could display kindness, she also had significant flaws, particularly in how she treated her husband. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the characterization of the woman, providing more information about her personality and relationships, specifically highlighting the contrast between her treatment of her children and her husband.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband||she openly brought her lover into their home||The first sentence states that "she" was dreadful to her war-damaged husband. The second sentence provides additional information about how she was dreadful by describing a specific action: she openly brought her lover into their home. This action is an expansion of the original statement about her behavior, providing more detail about the extent of her mistreatment towards her husband.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||She was untrained and , in one botched job killed a client . Her remorse was shallow and brief . Although she was kind and playful to her children , she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband ; she openly brought her lover into their home .||, Marie-Louise called Marie Latour in the film was not a nice person .||The first sentence provides several details about a character, including that she was untrained, killed a client, felt brief remorse, was kind to her children, but cruel to her war-damaged husband, and openly had an affair. The second sentence makes a general statement that Marie-Louise, called Marie Latour in the film, was not a nice person. The general statement in the second sentence expands upon the specific details provided in the first sentence, summarizing the negative aspects of her character. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory .||I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot , .||The first sentence describes the content of the picture, focusing on the prevalent themes of fighting and feasting. The second sentence explains why the picture is being mentioned, suggesting that despite its overall poor quality, there may be redeeming qualities. The expansion relationship is demonstrated here because the second sentence expands on the context of the first by providing a reason for mentioning the picture, which is to highlight potential redeeming features amidst its general lack of quality.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The three Japanese companies build the body sections of the 767 , accounting for a combined 15 % of the aircraft .||that the Japanese contribution could rise to between 20 % and 25 % under the new program||In the first sentence, we learn that the three Japanese companies currently manufacture body sections of the 767, contributing to 15% of the aircraft. The second sentence indicates a potential increase in their contribution to between 20% and 25% under a new program. This demonstrates a comparison between the current contribution (15%) and the future possible contribution (20-25%). The relationship is comparative, as it contrasts the existing level of involvement with a projected higher level.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||The screen fills with a small , tight facial shot of David Dinkins , Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City .||`` David Dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years , '' says a disembodied male voice .||The first sentence describes the appearance of a visual element - a tight facial shot of David Dinkins on the screen. The second sentence introduces an auditory element - a disembodied male voice making a statement about David Dinkins. The temporal relationship indicates that the male voice speaks after the screen fills with Dinkins' image. This sequence of events—first the visual display of Dinkins, then the voice speaking about him—establishes the temporal order between the two sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||, Mr. Dinkins 's TV consultants , Robert Shrum and David Doak , finally unleashed a negative ad of their own .||The screen shows two distorted , unrecognizable photos , presumably of two politicians .||The first sentence states that Mr. Dinkins's TV consultants, Robert Shrum and David Doak, released a negative ad. The second sentence then provides details about what is shown in this ad: two distorted, unrecognizable photos, presumably of two politicians. The second sentence expands on the content of the negative ad mentioned in the first sentence by describing a specific visual element of the ad. This additional information helps to clarify the nature of the negative ad, thus establishing an expansion relationship.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||The screen shows two distorted , unrecognizable photos , presumably of two politicians .||`` Compare two candidates for mayor , '' says the announcer .||In the first sentence, we learn that there are two distorted, unrecognizable photos displayed on the screen, and it is suggested that they are of two politicians. In the second sentence, the announcer instructs the audience to compare two candidates for mayor. The temporal relationship here indicates that the announcer's instruction to compare the candidates logically follows the display of the photos on the screen. It suggests that the photos were shown before the announcer spoke, creating a sequence of events where the visual presentation precedes the verbal instruction.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||`` One says he 's for banning cop-killer bullets .||The other has opposed a ban on cop-killer bullets .||The first sentence states that one person supports banning cop-killer bullets.The second sentence states that another person has opposed such a ban. The comparison relationship is evident because the two sentences contrast the positions of two different individuals on the same issue (banning cop-killer bullets). One is in favor of the ban, while the other is opposed to it, highlighting a difference in opinion.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||One claims he 's pro-choice .||The other has opposed a woman 's right to choose . ''||The first sentence states that someone claims to be pro-choice, indicating their stance on abortion rights.The second sentence states that another person has opposed a woman's right to choose, indicating their contrasting stance on the same issue. The comparison relationship is evident as the two sentences present opposing viewpoints on abortion rights, highlighting a contrast between being pro-choice and opposing choice.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Everybody -- and nobody .||It 's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate .||The first sentence presents a paradoxical statement, suggesting a situation where "everybody" and "nobody" are both applicable.The second sentence explains this paradox by describing it as a classic situation where advertisements can be technically true but not fully accurate. This provides additional context to understand the paradox introduced in the first sentence. Thus, the second sentence expands on the idea presented in the first one by offering an interpretation or explanation for the paradoxical statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Mr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years , but he insists he voluntarily admitted the `` oversight '' when he was being considered for a city job .||He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems , but he insists he made no secret of it .||The first sentence discusses one instance where Mr. Dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four years and then voluntarily disclosed this "oversight" during consideration for a city job. The second sentence introduces another instance where Mr. Dinkins was on the board of an insurance company with financial issues, and similarly, he claims he was open about it. Both sentences share a common theme of Mr. Dinkins facing potential issues and his insistence on being transparent about them. The second sentence expands on the idea presented in the first sentence by providing an additional example of Mr. Dinkins' transparency in facing potential ethical questions.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||The city 's Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr. Dinkins $ 95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete .||The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors .||The first sentence states that the city's Campaign Finance Board denied Mr. Dinkins matching funds due to incomplete campaign records. The second sentence explains that the campaign attributes these issues (presumably the incomplete records) to computer errors. While the relationship sought is 'comparison,' these sentences do not directly compare elements. Instead, they present different aspects of the same situation: the denial of funds and the campaign's explanation for the issue. A clearer comparison might involve contrasting how different campaigns handled similar situations. Given the provided relationship, the explanation does not neatly fit into 'comparison'; instead, it illustrates a causal connection, where the reason behind the incomplete records is given.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||the Dinkins ad is `` deceptive||The other side `` knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice , even though he has personal reservations .||The first sentence states that the Dinkins ad is deceptive. The second sentence provides information about Giuliani's stance on pro-choice, suggesting a reason for the deception: Giuliani is pro-choice with personal reservations. The contingency relationship is demonstrated because the deception in the ad is likely related to the need to address or counteract Giuliani's actual position on the issue, which could influence voters. The content of the ad (its deceptive nature) is contingent upon Giuliani's known stance and potential voter perception.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The other side `` knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice , even though he has personal reservations .||They know he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets , but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation . ''||The first sentence states that "the other side" knows about Giuliani's stance on being pro-choice despite having personal reservations. The second sentence expands on this theme by providing another example of Giuliani's position: being generally opposed to cop-killer bullets but having reservations about the specific language in related legislation. Both sentences show instances where Giuliani holds a primary position with additional personal reservations, illustrating the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.List', 'first'] ||Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force .||Against a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag , an announcer talks about the `` strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty '' that Virginians have nurtured for generations .||The first sentence states that Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder launched his campaign for governor with an abortion-themed commercial produced by Frank Greer, which was widely praised by political analysts. The second sentence provides more detail about the content of the commercial, describing the visuals and the message conveyed through the announcer's words. This additional information expands on the description of the commercial mentioned in the first sentence, giving insight into how the commercial conveyed the "tour de force" quality noted by analysts.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||That commercial changed the dynamics of the campaign , transforming it , at least in part , into a referendum on abortion .||The ad prompted Mr. Coleman , the former Virginia attorney general , to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad .||The first sentence indicates that the mentioned commercial had a significant impact on the campaign, turning it partly into a referendum on abortion. The second sentence explains a subsequent action taken by Mr. Coleman, who started a series of ads aimed at undermining Mr. Wilder's support among the same demographic that the initial ad targeted. Mr. Coleman's action was contingent upon the effect of the first commercial, as he sought to counter its influence.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal .||A voice says , `` C'mon , now , do n't you have boyfriends ? ''||The first sentence indicates that there was an advertisement where a woman recalled an unpleasant courtroom experience. The second sentence introduces a voice saying, "C'mon, now, don't you have boyfriends?" The temporal relationship is evident because the voice's comment follows the recollection of the courtroom ordeal in the advertisement. This implies that the voice's remark comes after the content of the ad, setting up a sequence of events where the ad plays, and then the voice speaks subsequently.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago , but he did so at the request of a constituent , a common legislative technique used by lawmakers .||The legislation itself noted that it was introduced `` by request||The first sentence states that Mr. Wilder introduced legislation 17 years ago at the request of a constituent and explains that this is a common legislative technique. The second sentence provides additional detail about the same legislation, specifying that it was indeed introduced "by request," which aligns with the information provided in the first sentence. Therefore, the second sentence expands upon the information given in the first sentence by confirming the reason for the introduction of the legislation, reinforcing the notion that it was introduced at someone else's request.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner||`` Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman . ''||The first sentence indicates that people are tired of certain ads and that Coleman has received a negative reputation as a result. The second sentence explains how Wilder has contributed to this situation by portraying Coleman as dishonest and placing blame for negative campaigning on him. Thus, the second sentence shows the action taken by Wilder that led to the outcome described in the first sentence, creating a contingent relationship. The framing of Coleman by Wilder is contingent upon the outcome of public perception toward Coleman.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning , but the truce lasted only hours .||By Tuesday night , television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder 's sensitivity to rape victims .||The first sentence states that Mr. Coleman announced he would focus on positive campaigning for the rest of the political season, yet this truce was short-lived. The second sentence provides more detail about how quickly the truce ended and what form the negative campaigning took: by Tuesday night, new ads appeared where Mr. Coleman questioned Mr. Wilder's sensitivity to rape victims. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving specific examples of the negative campaigning that began shortly after the announcement.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio 's rival , Republican Rep. Jim Courter .||`` Remember Pinocchio ? '' says a female voice .||The first sentence describes the start of attacks in a political context, involving an ad aired by Democratic Rep. James Florio that includes a drawing of Pinocchio and a photo of his rival, Republican Rep. Jim Courter. The second sentence provides a detail from the ad itself, specifically the line "Remember Pinocchio?" spoken by a female voice. The temporal relationship indicates that the occurrence of the female voice saying "Remember Pinocchio?" happens within the context of the ad being aired, following its description. Thus, the second event (the voice speaking) occurs after the first event (the airing of the ad) in time, establishing the temporal relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||And then this commercial , produced by Bob Squier , gets down to its own mean and dirty business .||Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus , and the female voice purrs , `` That hazardous waste on his Mr. Courter 's property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud . ''||The first sentence introduces a commercial produced by Bob Squier that delves into negative campaigning. The second sentence provides specific details of what occurs in the commercial: pictures of rusted oil drums coming into focus and a narration about a legal issue involving hazardous waste on Mr. Courter's property. The second sentence expands upon the description of the commercial by providing concrete examples of the "mean and dirty business" mentioned in the first sentence.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||In this one , the screen fills with photographs of both candidates .||`` Who 's really lying ? '' asks a female voice .||The first sentence describes a visual event where the screen fills with photographs of both candidates. The second sentence introduces an auditory event, a female voice asking a question. The temporal relationship indicates that these events occur in sequence, likely with the visuals appearing before the voiceover. Thus, the screen filling with photographs is followed by the question being asked by the female voice, establishing a temporal sequence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate||Barrels were dumped on the Courter property , a complaint was made , but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment .||The first sentence states that there is an advertisement that, while true, is not entirely accurate. The second sentence provides an example of a situation that aligns with the description from the first sentence: barrels being dumped, a complaint made, yet no proof of significant environmental harm. The example in the second sentence serves to illustrate the point made in the first sentence, showing a scenario where the truth is not fully represented. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the second sentence depends on the first for context and meaning.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||But it 's building on a long tradition .||In 1966 , on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O'Connor , GOP Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person saying , `` If you want to keep the crime rates high , O'Connor is your man . ''||The first sentence makes a claim about something building on a long tradition. The second sentence provides an example from 1966 where GOP Governor Nelson Rockefeller used a strong statement during his campaign, which can be seen as part of the tradition mentioned in the first sentence. This example expands on the idea presented in the first sentence by offering a specific historical instance that illustrates the tradition being referenced. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by providing additional information that supports and clarifies the initial claim.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Asia 's other cash-rich countries are following Japan 's lead and pumping capital into the region .||In Taiwan and South Korea , rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production .||The first sentence indicates that Asia's other cash-rich countries are following Japan's lead in pumping capital into the region. The second sentence discusses a specific action taken in Taiwan and South Korea, which are also part of Asia and potentially cash-rich, as they move labor-intensive production overseas due to rising wages. The contingency relationship is evident because the action taken by Taiwan and South Korea (seeking other overseas sites for production) is contingent upon the broader context of Asian countries investing in the region and following Japan's lead. Specifically, the economic dynamics at play in the region, including capital investment and rising wages, are leading to decisions like moving production overseas.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||In Taiwan and South Korea , rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production .||These nations , known as Asia 's `` little tigers , '' also are contributing to Southeast Asia 's integration||The first sentence explains that rising wages in Taiwan and South Korea are causing manufacturers to look for new locations for labor-intensive work. The second sentence then discusses how these same nations, referred to as Asia's "little tigers," are contributing to Southeast Asia's integration. The contingency relationship is evident because the action of these nations (contributing to Southeast Asia's integration) is contingent upon the situation described (manufacturers seeking other locations due to rising wages). The contribution to integration is a consequence of the manufacturers' need to find alternative sites for production.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||But it resists yielding political ground .||In the coming decade U.S.-Japanese relations will be tested as Tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic behemoth .||The first sentence indicates that there is resistance to conceding political ground, suggesting a context where power dynamics are significant. The second sentence discusses a future scenario where U.S.-Japanese relations will face challenges as Japan adapts to its role as a major economic power in the region. The contingency relationship is established because the testing of U.S.-Japanese relations (second sentence) is contingent upon the resistance mentioned in the first sentence, implying that this resistance could play a role in the challenges that arise in the bilateral relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Japan 's swelling investment in Southeast Asia is part of its economic evolution .||In the past decade , Japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export . In the 1990s , spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen , these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world .||The first sentence states that Japan's growing investment in Southeast Asia is part of its economic evolution. The following sentences provide context for this evolution: they describe how Japanese manufacturers focused on domestic production for export in the past decade, but now, due to rising labor costs and a stronger yen, they plan to transform into multinational corporations with global facilities. This shift from domestic focus to international expansion explains why the investment in Southeast Asia is considered part of Japan's economic evolution, thus creating an expansion relationship.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||In the past decade , Japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export .||In the 1990s , spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen , these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world .||The first sentence describes the focus of Japanese manufacturers on domestic production for export over the past decade.The second sentence predicts a shift in strategy for these manufacturers in the 1990s due to rising labor costs and a strong yen. The relationship is temporal because it outlines a sequence of events: first, the manufacturers focused on domestic production; then, in the subsequent period (the 1990s), they plan to become more multinational in nature. The second sentence occurs chronologically after the first, indicating a change in approach over time.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Synchrony', 'meanwhile'] ||In the 1990s , spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen , these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world .||To capture the investment , Southeast Asian nations will move to accommodate Japanese business .||The first sentence outlines a scenario where, during the 1990s, companies are driven by specific factors (rising labor costs and a strong yen) to transform into multinationals with global factories. The second sentence predicts a response from Southeast Asian nations, which plan to adjust their policies to attract this investment. The temporal relationship is established through the sequence of events: first, the companies' transformation occurs due to economic conditions, and subsequently, Southeast Asian nations respond by adapting to appeal to these companies. This sequence demonstrates a chronological order, where the actions of one party follow the changes initiated by another.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Countries in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties .||The economic and foreign ministers of 12 Asian and Pacific nations will meet in Australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications .||The first sentence states that countries in the region are starting to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties. The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying that the economic and foreign ministers from 12 Asian and Pacific nations will meet to discuss various issues, including global trade and regional matters like transportation and telecommunications. This meeting serves as an example of the closer ties being considered, making the second sentence an expansion of the idea introduced in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||In Asia , as in Europe , a new order is taking shape||`` The U.S. , with its regional friends , must play a crucial role in designing its architecture . ''||The first sentence describes the emergence of a new order in Asia, similar to what is happening in Europe. The second sentence suggests that the U.S., along with its regional friends, has a critical role in designing the architecture of this new order. The contingency relationship is established because the role that the U.S. and its allies should play (designing the architecture of the new order) is contingent upon the emergence of the new order itself. The need for the U.S. to participate in shaping the new order depends on the fact that such a new order is forming.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||But maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region .||Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries .||The first sentence states that maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult due to Japanese dominance in the region. The second sentence explains why it will be challenging by providing specific reasons: Japan outstrips the U.S. in investment flows and outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries. Thus, the second sentence expands on the difficulty mentioned in the first sentence by giving concrete examples of Japan's economic advantage over the U.S. in the region.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||Moreover , the Japanese government , now the world 's largest aid donor , is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is .||While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan 's enlarged role in Asia , they also convey an undertone of caution .||The first sentence highlights that the Japanese government, being the world's largest aid donor, is providing significantly more assistance to the region than the U.S. The second sentence then describes the U.S. officials' response to Japan's increased role, showing an element of optimism but also caution. The contingency relationship is evident here because the U.S. officials' cautious optimism is a direct response to the situation described in the first sentence, where Japan's larger role in providing aid is outlined. The officials' stance is contingent upon Japan's actions.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan 's enlarged role in Asia , they also convey an undertone of caution .||`` There 's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions '' in Asia , says J. Michael Farren , undersecretary of commerce for trade . `` If they approach it with a benevolent , altruistic attitude , there will be a net gain for everyone . ''||The first sentence outlines the nuanced perspective of U.S. officials towards Japan's expanded role in Asia, expressing both optimism and caution. The second sentence quotes J. Michael Farren, who elaborates on the U.S.'s understanding of Japan's need to expand its functions in Asia and conditions the positive outcome on Japan adopting a benevolent, altruistic attitude. This quote expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by providing more detail on the U.S.'s viewpoint and the desired approach from Japan, hence the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||There 's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions '' in Asia||`` If they approach it with a benevolent , altruistic attitude , there will be a net gain for everyone . ''||The first sentence indicates that the United States acknowledges Japan's need to expand its role in Asia.The second sentence further elaborates on the potential positive outcomes if Japan adopts a specific approach (benevolent and altruistic) to this expansion. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence builds upon the idea introduced in the first, providing more detail about the benefits of Japan's expanded role under certain conditions.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the U.S. 's leases on military bases in the Philippines and by a possible U.S. troop reduction in South Korea .||Many Asians regard a U.S. presence as a desirable counterweight to Japanese influence .||The first sentence outlines complications regarding the U.S.'s military presence in Asia due to uncertainties about its bases in the Philippines and troop levels in South Korea. The second sentence introduces a perspective from many Asians who view the U.S. presence as beneficial against Japanese influence. The contingency relationship is evident because the positive view of the U.S. presence by some Asians (second sentence) is contingent upon the uncertain future of the U.S. military commitments in the region (first sentence). The uncertainty complicates the issue and influences the perception of the U.S. presence as a counterbalance.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Synchrony', 'meanwhile'] ||Cathryn Rice could hardly believe her eyes .||While giving the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills to ninth graders at Greenville High School last March 16 , she spotted a student looking at crib sheets .||The first sentence states that Cathryn Rice was surprised by something she saw. The second sentence provides context for her surprise: while administering a test on a specific date, she noticed a student cheating. The temporal relationship is established through the sequence of events—the observation of cheating occurred during the test, leading to Cathryn Rice's reaction of disbelief. Thus, the second sentence takes place after the initial moment of surprise described in the first sentence, setting up a temporal connection.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||She had seen cheating before , but these notes were uncanny .||`` A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance ... . At the end of World War II , Germany surrendered before Japan ... . The Senate-House conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the House and Senate in different forms . ''||The first sentence indicates that "she" had observed cheating previously, and the notes in question were particularly remarkable or unusual. The subsequent sentences do not directly relate to the context of cheating or the notes. Instead, they provide unrelated information about a stockbroker's profession, historical events regarding World War II, and the legislative process. These sentences expand the discussion by introducing new, distinct topics rather than continuing the original thread about cheating. Therefore, the relationship between the first sentence and the following sentences is one of expansion, where additional, unrelated information is provided.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||The student surrendered the notes , but not without a protest .||My teacher said it was OK for me to use the notes on the test||The first sentence states that the student gave up the notes with a protest. The second sentence expands on the context of why the student might have been protesting by providing additional information: the teacher had previously allowed the use of notes during the test. This additional information helps to explain the student's reluctance to surrender the notes, thus expanding on the situation presented in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'indeed'] ||The teacher in question was Nancy Yeargin -- considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school .||she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low-ability geography classes||The first sentence introduces Nancy Yeargin as a highly regarded teacher at the school. The second sentence provides additional information about her actions: she gave the questions and answers to two low-ability geography classes before the exam. This further elaborates on her character or actions, showing how she supported these specific students. Thus, the second sentence expands on the description of the teacher introduced in the first sentence, illustrating her teaching methods and commitment to helping students.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low-ability geography classes||She had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers .||The first sentence states that "she" gave the questions and answers to two low-ability geography classes two days before the examination. The second sentence provides more details about how she did this: by displaying the questions on an overhead projector and underlining the answers. The second sentence expands on the first by giving additional information about the method used to provide the questions and answers, hence the expansion relationship.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||Mrs. Yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual South Carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security .||In September , she pleaded guilty and paid a $ 500 fine .||The first sentence states that Mrs. Yeargin was fired and prosecuted under a specific South Carolina law for breaching test security.The second sentence describes an event that happened later, in September, where she pleaded guilty and paid a $500 fine. The temporal relationship is established by the sequence of events: the prosecution and firing occurred before the plea and payment of the fine in September.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'previously'] ||Her story is partly one of personal downfall .||She was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students||The first sentence discusses the theme of personal downfall in her story, suggesting a negative turn in her life.The second sentence then introduces a different aspect of her story, focusing on her role as an effective and inspiring teacher. This implies a shift in the narrative, where the information about her teaching comes after the mention of her personal downfall, establishing a temporal relationship. However, this example seems to better fit a contrast or elaboration rather than a clear temporal sequence, as the content does not explicitly show one event following another in time.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||but she will probably never teach again .||In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer ; ; ; .||The first sentence states that the woman will likely never teach again. The second sentence provides additional context by explaining the emotional aftermath of her actions, specifically detailing the negative feelings of a principal who was once her friend. This additional information expands on the reason why she may never teach again, by illustrating the severity of the situation and the impact on personal relationships. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the implications of the first sentence, providing more detail about the consequences of her actions.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Mrs. Yeargin 's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform , .||The 1987 statute Mrs. Yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of South Carolina 's school-improvement laws .||The first sentence indicates that Mrs. Yeargin's case reveals issues related to school reform. The second sentence provides context for her violation, explaining that she broke a 1987 statute aimed at enforcing school improvement laws. This shows that the violation (the event in the second sentence) happened under circumstances that led to the revelation mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, as the details provided (about the nature of the law broken) explain part of the "dark side" referenced in the initial sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students ' scores to win a bonus under the state 's 1984 Education Improvement Act .||The bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student-test scores .||The first sentence states that prosecutors claimed she was attempting to increase students' scores to earn a bonus under a specific act. The second sentence explains that the bonus was dependent on her ability to generate higher test scores from students. The contingency relationship is evident because the bonus (second sentence) is contingent upon the successful increase in student test scores (first sentence). In other words, the bonus was conditional on her achieving higher student test scores.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||that `` outright cheating by American educators '' is `` common||standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often `` teach the test '' as Mrs. Yeargin did , although most are never caught||The first sentence makes a claim about "outright cheating by American educators" being common. The second sentence provides specific examples of how this cheating occurs, such as teaching to the test and inflating test scores. This sentence expands upon the initial claim by offering more detail about the nature and methods of the alleged cheating. It further explains what is meant by "outright cheating" and how it manifests in educational settings.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so .||California 's education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test .||The first sentence states that evidence of widespread cheating has been discovered in multiple states recently. The second sentence provides a specific instance of this cheating, detailing the situation in California where adults are suspected of altering test answers from incorrect to correct. This detailed account of cheating in California expands on the more general statement about cheating in several states, providing concrete examples and details. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information presented in the first one.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||California 's education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test .||After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students , Texas is revising its security practices .||The first sentence discusses the situation in California where there are suspicions of adults altering test results for students by changing wrong answers to right ones. The second sentence moves to a related but expanded context, discussing how Texas is responding to similar issues by revising its security practices. This expansion introduces a new instance of the same broader issue (adult interference in student testing) in a different location (Texas). The relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, as the second sentence broadens the scope of the issue beyond just California to include actions taken in Texas.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||And sales of test-coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming .||These materials , including Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. 's Scoring High and Learning Materials -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets , according to some recent academic research .||The first sentence indicates that sales of test-coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming. The second sentence provides additional information about these materials, naming specific examples (Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co.'s Scoring High and Learning Materials) and describing them as "sophisticated crib sheets" based on recent academic research. This further elaborates on the nature of the materials mentioned in the first sentence, expanding our understanding of what these booming sales consist of and how they are perceived in academic circles.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Since the reforms went in place , for example , no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina , .||South Carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much||The first sentence highlights South Carolina's success in improving Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores since certain reforms were implemented. The second sentence discusses the potential downside or consequence of focusing heavily on improved test scores. The comparison relationship is evident as the second sentence contrasts the positive outcome mentioned in the first sentence with a potential negative effect, indicating that while there has been success in improving SAT scores, there may also be drawbacks related to overemphasizing these scores.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Critics say South Carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much .||Friends of Education rates South Carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating .||The first sentence states that critics claim South Carolina is suffering consequences for overemphasizing improved test scores. The second sentence provides additional information about the specific consequences by mentioning that South Carolina has been rated poorly in a study on academic cheating. This detail expands on the idea of what "paying a price" means in the context of the first sentence, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Friends of Education rates South Carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating .||Says the organization 's founder , John Cannell , prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is `` a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously , when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all . ''||The first sentence states that South Carolina has been rated poorly by Friends of Education in a study on academic cheating. The second sentence provides additional context through a quote from John Cannell, the organization's founder, suggesting a motive for why administrators might choose to prosecute someone like Mrs. Yeargin. This quote expands on the context of the issue by explaining a potential reason behind the actions taken by administrators in response to the problem of cheating. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information presented in the first, providing insight into the possible motivations of school administrators in the context of the state's poor rating.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class||`` Crime was awful , test scores were low , and there was no enrollment in honors programs . ''||The first sentence outlines several issues within a certain context (likely a school environment): violence, gangs, and students skipping classes. The second sentence provides more specific details about the problems mentioned in the first sentence: crime being awful can be linked to the violence and gangs; low test scores align with the issue of kids cutting class, indicating poor academic performance; and the lack of enrollment in honors programs further emphasizes the educational challenges faced. Thus, the second sentence expands upon the initial statement by offering more concrete examples and consequences of the broader issues described.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||and she also had some new factors working in her behalf .||One was statewide school reform , .||The first sentence indicates there are new factors working in "her" behalf. The second sentence introduces "One was statewide school reform," which serves to expand upon the initial statement by providing an example of one such factor. This creates an expansion relationship, where additional information is given to clarify or elaborate on the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.List', 'and'] ||One was statewide school reform , .||Another was Nancy Yeargin , .||The first sentence introduces a topic, which is "statewide school reform." The second sentence expands upon this topic by introducing "Nancy Yeargin," who is likely related to the context of statewide school reform. Since no other information is provided about Nancy Yeargin's role or connection, we can infer that mentioning her name serves to expand the discussion on statewide school reform, possibly indicating her involvement or importance in the reform process.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||I loved the school , its history .||I even dreamt about school and new things to do with my students . ''||In the first sentence, the speaker expresses their affection for the school and its history. In the second sentence, the speaker further elaborates on their feelings by mentioning that they dream about the school and new activities involving their students. This second sentence expands on the depth of the speaker's feelings toward the school, showing how much they care about it and are invested in it, beyond just loving it and its history.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||In 1986-87 and 1987-88 , she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law .||Encouraged by Mrs. Ward , Mrs. Yeargin taught honor students in the state `` teacher cadet '' program , .||The first sentence states that "she" (referring to Mrs. Yeargin) applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law in specific years. The second sentence introduces additional information about Mrs. Yeargin's activities: teaching honor students in the "teacher cadet" program, encouraged by Mrs. Ward. This additional detail expands our understanding of Mrs. Yeargin’s role and involvement in educational programs during the period mentioned in the first sentence, hence the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Encouraged by Mrs. Ward , Mrs. Yeargin taught honor students in the state `` teacher cadet '' program , a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career .||She won grant money for the school , advised cheerleaders , ran the pep club , proposed and taught a new `` Cultural Literacy '' class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school PTA as `` Teacher of the Year . ''||The first sentence outlines Mrs. Yeargin's role in teaching honor students in the "teacher cadet" program, encouraged by Mrs. Ward. This highlights her involvement in educational reforms and initiatives to inspire students to consider teaching careers.The second sentence expands on Mrs. Yeargin's contributions by detailing additional activities she engaged in, such as winning grants, advising cheerleaders, running the pep club, proposing and teaching a new class in Cultural Literacy, and being recognized as "Teacher of the Year" by the school PTA. These details serve to provide a broader picture of Mrs. Yeargin’s involvement and impact at the school, enhancing our understanding of her role beyond just teaching in the "teacher cadet" program. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||She was an inspirational lady||she had it all together||The first sentence states that "she" was an inspirational lady. The second sentence provides additional information about her, stating that "she had it all together." This further elaborates on why she is considered inspirational, suggesting that her life was well-organized or she managed various aspects of her life effectively. The second sentence expands on the qualities that make her inspirational, thus forming an expansion relationship with the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||she had it all together||that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher||The first sentence states that "she" had everything together, suggesting a sense of personal stability or accomplishment. The second sentence provides additional context about her decision to change career paths from architecture to teaching due to Mrs. Yeargin's influence. This additional information expands on the initial statement by explaining a significant life decision that contributed to her having "it all together." The shift in career ambition is part of the broader context of her overall situation, thus forming an expansionary relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Mrs. Yeargin inspired her to go into education||She taught us more in Western Civilization than I 've ever learned in other classes||The first sentence states that Mrs. Yeargin inspired her to go into education, suggesting a significant impact on her career choice. The second sentence expands on Mrs. Yeargin's influence by providing a specific example of her teaching effectiveness in a Western Civilization class, implying that this quality of teaching was part of what made her inspiring. Therefore, the second sentence adds detail and context to the first, illustrating how Mrs. Yeargin's teaching inspired her. This connection establishes the expansion relationship between the two sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||In the classroom Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches -- .||On weekends , she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes , even to polish the furniture in her classroom .||The first sentence states that Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by varying her teaching approaches in the classroom.The second sentence provides additional details about her dedication, including coming in on weekends to prepare study plans and even polish the furniture.These actions further exemplify her commitment to teaching and her classroom, thus expanding on the idea presented in the first sentence. The additional information about her weekend activities supports and expands the notion of her varied and dedicated approach to teaching.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||She just never gave it up||`` You 'd see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game . ''||The first sentence states that "she just never gave it up," suggesting dedication or persistence in something.The second sentence provides an example of her dedication by describing a specific situation where she was seen correcting homework at an unusual place (in the stands at a football game).This specific instance expands on the idea presented in the first sentence, showing how committed she was to her work, even while attending a football game. Therefore, the second sentence expands the notion introduced in the first sentence, illustrating her unwavering commitment.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Some fellow teachers , however , viewed Mrs. Yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students .||she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander||The first sentence states that some fellow teachers viewed Mrs. Yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students. The second sentence provides additional information about how Mrs. Yeargin dealt with these criticisms, specifically mentioning that she often defended herself to colleagues who called her a grandstander. This additional detail expands upon the initial statement about her reputation among her peers, offering insight into her response to their views. Therefore, the second sentence is providing an expansion of the first one by explaining her behavior in the context of those views.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Pressures began to build .||Friends told her she was pushing too hard .||The first sentence indicates that pressures were increasing. The second sentence provides more context about these pressures, specifically mentioning that the subject's friends were advising her against pushing too hard. This additional information expands upon the nature of the pressures mentioned in the first sentence, explaining that they may have been related to the subject's behavior or actions. Therefore, the second sentence expands the details around the pressures described in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Friends told her she was pushing too hard .||she feared she might not be able to teach much longer||The first sentence indicates that the subject was warned by friends that she was working too hard. The second sentence expands on the consequences of her actions by revealing her fear that she might not be able to continue teaching. The intensity of her work has led to a specific concern or realization about her future in teaching, thus deepening the understanding of the initial issue described in the first sentence. The second sentence provides additional insight into the potential ramifications of pushing too hard, which is an expansion of the idea presented initially.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||But the most important source of points was student improvement on tests .||Huge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of $ 5,000 in bonuses over two years -- a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $ 23,000 .||The first sentence states that the most significant source of points for bonuses was student improvement on tests.The second sentence provides specific evidence of this by detailing the substantial gains made by the teacher's students in 1987 and 1988, resulting in a total of $5,000 in bonuses for the teacher over two years. This specific instance serves to expand upon the general statement in the first sentence, illustrating how student improvement directly led to bonus earnings.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||she was eager to win -- if not for money , then for pride and recognition||she believed Mrs. Yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing||The first sentence indicates the subject's motivation for winning, which includes pride and recognition rather than money. The second sentence expands on this theme by providing a specific reason for her desire to maintain a high standing: to secure a new job that wouldn't require good hearing. This additional detail explains one of the motivations mentioned in the first sentence (pride and recognition) by giving a concrete example of how maintaining her standing could benefit her. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information presented in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Last March , after attending a teaching seminar in Washington , she returned to Greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she had n't prepared her low-ability geography students adequately .||When test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students||The first sentence indicates that the teacher felt unprepared for the annual testing after attending a seminar. The second sentence describes her action of copying test questions and providing the answers to her students. This action is contingent upon her initial feelings of inadequacy, as she sought to compensate for her perceived lack of preparation by giving her students the answers. Her decision to cheat on the test was directly influenced by her concerns about her students' readiness.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||her motives were correct||I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation||The first sentence asserts that "her motives were correct." The second sentence explains what those correct motives were by stating, "I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation." The second sentence expands on the first by providing specific details about the correct motives mentioned, thus the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation||`` Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions .||The first sentence indicates the speaker's intention to help kids in an unfair testing situation. The second sentence provides specific information about the test: only five out of 40 questions were geography questions. This detail may explain why the testing situation was considered unfair, suggesting that the contingency lies in the disproportionate number of questions from different subjects, which could have made the test challenging for students expecting a balanced assessment. The disproportionate distribution of questions supports the claim of an unfair testing situation.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||`` Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions .||The rest were history , sociology , finance -- subjects they never had . ''||The first sentence states that only five out of 40 questions were geography questions. The second sentence explains what the remaining questions were about: history, sociology, finance, and other subjects that the participants had not studied before. This establishes a comparison between the number and subject matter of the geography questions versus the other types of questions. By indicating that most of the questions were not geography but rather other subjects, the relationship between the two sentences is one of comparison.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||that she also wanted to help lift Greenville High School 's overall test scores , usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers||Mostly she wanted to prevent the damage to self-esteem that her low-ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test .||In the first sentence, the subject's motivation is described as aiming to improve Greenville High School's overall test scores, which are typically low among district high schools. In the second sentence, another aspect of her motivation is presented: preventing damage to her students' self-esteem from poor test performance. The comparison relationship is evident because both sentences discuss different facets of the same motivation (improving outcomes for the school and its students). The subject's broader goal encompasses both improving the school's standing and protecting her students' self-esteem, thus comparing two related but distinct objectives.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Mostly she wanted to prevent the damage to self-esteem that her low-ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test .||These kids broke my heart||The first sentence indicates the primary motivation for the speaker's actions towards her low-ability students, which is to prevent damage to their self-esteem from poor test performance. The second sentence expresses the speaker's emotional state when thinking about these students, specifically that they "broke her heart." The contingency relationship is evident because the speaker's emotional state (having her heart broken by the students' situation) influences her motivation to protect their self-esteem. Her emotional response leads to her desire to prevent further harm, making the second sentence contingent upon the first.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||These kids broke my heart||`` A whole day goes by and no one even knows they 're alive .||The first sentence expresses a strong emotional reaction (heartbreak) from the speaker toward "these kids." The second sentence gives a reason for this emotional state by describing the difficult circumstances these kids face, specifically that they can go unnoticed for an entire day. The speaker's emotional state (heartbreak) is contingent upon the realization or understanding of the kids' situation, creating a contingent relationship between the two sentences.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||`` A whole day goes by and no one even knows they 're alive .||They desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them , who loved them .||The first sentence indicates a situation where a person feels unnoticed or unacknowledged for an entire day.The second sentence expresses the person's need for someone who cares and loves them. The contingency relationship is evident because the need for affection and attention (second sentence) is contingent upon the experience of feeling unnoticed (first sentence). The feeling of being overlooked leads to the desperation for care and love.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||They desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them , who loved them .||The last thing they needed was another drag-down blow . ''||The first sentence highlights the urgent need for someone who cares and loves them.The second sentence contrasts this by mentioning what they do not need: another negative experience (a "drag-down blow").The comparison is drawn between the positive need for affection and the negative impact of further harm. By stating "the last thing they needed," the text implies a contrast with what would be beneficial (love and care), thereby setting up a comparative relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Pragmatic cause', 'because'] ||Mrs. Yeargin is lying||They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help , .||The first sentence states that Mrs. Yeargin is lying. The second sentence provides evidence for her dishonesty by mentioning that other students from an advanced class a year earlier claimed she provided them with similar assistance. The second sentence supports the claim made in the first sentence, explaining why one might believe that Mrs. Yeargin is lying. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is contingent, as the second sentence provides additional information that justifies the assertion in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help , .||That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child||The first sentence states that students in an advanced class a year earlier claimed that she provided them with similar assistance. This information serves as evidence or context for the second sentence, which interprets this situation as undermining the idea that her actions were aimed at helping underprivileged children. The second sentence's interpretation depends on the information presented in the first sentence, hence the relationship is one of contingency. The assertion that her intentions weren't altruistic toward underprivileged children is contingent upon the fact that she had previously assisted students in an advanced class.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'indeed'] ||That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child||that she went over the questions in the earlier class||The first part of the sentence indicates that there's an action or intention of the subject that is being negated ("defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child"). The second part provides additional context or elaboration on what the subject did instead ("that she went over the questions in the earlier class"). This further explains or expands upon the reason why her actions didn't align with helping the underprivileged child. The expansion comes from providing more detail about what she actually did during the class, which contrasts with the initial expectation set in the first part.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Mrs. Yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair||Do I have much sympathy for her ?||The first sentence indicates that Mrs. Yeargin did not complain to school officials about the fairness of the standardized test. The second sentence raises a question about whether the speaker has sympathy for her. The contingency relationship here can be explained as follows: The absence of a complaint from Mrs. Yeargin (first sentence) leads to a consideration of whether this lack of action warrants sympathy (second sentence). The speaker's sympathy may be contingent upon understanding or agreeing with Mrs. Yeargin's decision not to complain.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Do I have much sympathy for her ?||`` Not really .||The first sentence is a question asking whether the speaker has much sympathy for someone. The second sentence "Not really" directly answers this question, indicating that the speaker does not have much sympathy. The relationship between the sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence provides more information or clarification about the content of the first sentence. Here, the answer "Not really" expands on the initial question by providing the speaker's actual feelings.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||`` Not really .||I believe in the system .||The first sentence "Not really" implies a level of doubt or disagreement. The second sentence "I believe in the system" provides a contrasting belief or perspective. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here as the speaker's belief in the system seems to be offered as a reason or counterpoint to the initial doubt expressed. Thus, the speaker's affirmation of belief is contingent upon addressing or contradicting the implied skepticism in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||I believe in the system .||I believe you have to use the system to change it .||The first sentence states the speaker's belief in the system.The second sentence expands on this belief by explaining how the speaker thinks the system should be used: to bring about change. It provides more context and detail about the speaker's stance on the system, thus expanding on the initial statement.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||you have to use the system to change it||What she did was like taking the law into your own hands . ''||The first sentence states that one must use the system to effect change.The second sentence compares "what she did" to "taking the law into your own hands." This implies that her actions were likened to bypassing normal procedures, much like someone would if they took justice into their own hands without following legal processes. Thus, the comparison is drawn between her actions and the concept of self-enforced justice, illustrating a parallel in the manner of acting outside established systems.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||that when the cheating was discovered , she wanted to avoid the morale-damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring||she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation||The first sentence indicates the reason for her action - to avoid the morale damage from disclosing the cheating publicly.The second sentence presents the action taken - offering Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation. This resignation is offered as a means to achieve the goal stated in the first sentence (avoiding a public trial). Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the action in the second sentence is contingent upon the motivation provided in the first sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate||Mrs. Yeargin declined .||The first sentence indicates that "she" provided Mrs. Yeargin with a quiet resignation and believed this act could assist Mrs. Yeargin in preserving her teaching certificate. The second sentence states that Mrs. Yeargin did not accept this offer. The comparison here lies in contrasting the proposed solution (quiet resignation to save the teaching certificate) with its rejection by Mrs. Yeargin. The relationship is comparative as it contrasts "her" belief in the potential effectiveness of the quiet resignation with Mrs. Yeargin's decision not to pursue this option.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Mrs. Yeargin declined .||`` She said something like ` You just want to make it easy for the school . '||The first sentence states that Mrs. Yeargin declined, indicating her refusal of something. The second sentence provides additional context about her refusal by explaining what she said when declining. Specifically, she expressed the belief that the intention behind the request was to make things easier for the school. This additional information expands on the reason for her refusal, thus establishing an expansion relationship between the two sentences.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||`` She said something like ` You just want to make it easy for the school . '||I was dumbfounded||In the first sentence, "she" makes a remark suggesting that someone wants to make things easier for the school. In the second sentence, the speaker ("I") reacts to this remark by being dumbfounded. The contingency relationship is evident here because the speaker's reaction (being dumbfounded) is contingent upon the remark made by "she." The speaker's emotional state is a direct result of the comment, showing how one event (the remark) leads to another (the speaker's surprise).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||I was dumbfounded||`` It was like someone had turned a knife in me . ''||The first sentence states that the speaker was "dumbfounded," indicating a strong emotional reaction.The second sentence provides additional detail about the nature of this reaction by comparing it to the feeling of having a knife turned inside them. This simile expands upon the intensity and character of the speaker's emotional state, offering a vivid description of what being "dumbfounded" felt like for them. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving a more detailed account of the speaker's emotional experience.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs . Yeargin won widespread local support .||The school-board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students , teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf .||The first sentence states that Mrs. Yeargin received widespread local support, which was surprising to her superiors and legal authorities. The second sentence expands on this point by providing specific details about the support she received: the school-board hearing was crowded with people (students, teachers, and parents) who came to testify in her favor. This detail further illustrates the extent of the support mentioned in the first sentence, hence the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The school-board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students , teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf .||Supportive callers decried unfair testing , not Mrs. Yeargin , on a local radio talk show on which she appeared .||The first sentence indicates that there was significant support for the teacher at the school-board hearing, with many people attending to speak in her favor. The second sentence further elaborates on this support by describing another instance where callers to a local radio show also defended her, albeit focusing on the issue of unfair testing rather than the teacher herself. Both sentences highlight different aspects of the support she received, one at the hearing and the other on the radio show. This makes the relationship between the sentences one of expansion, as they both contribute to the overall theme of support for the teacher.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The message to the board of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we 're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state||Editorials in the Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs. Yeargin was wrong , but also said the case showed how testing was being overused .||The first sentence states that there needs to be a serious examination of the curriculum and testing policies within the state. The second sentence expands on this idea by providing a specific example of how testing policies are being overused, referencing editorials in the Greenville newspaper that discuss Mrs. Yeargin's case. This case serves as evidence supporting the need for the serious look mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the issue raised in the first sentence by offering additional detail through a particular instance where testing policies were criticized.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The radio show `` enraged us||Partly because of the show the district decided not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first-time offenders program .||The first sentence states that the radio show enraged the speaker and likely others. The second sentence provides additional information about the consequences of the radio show, specifically how it influenced the district's decision regarding Mrs. Yeargin. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence adds more context to the impact of the radio show, explaining one reason (partly because of the show) for the district's decision not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first-time offenders program. This additional detail broadens our understanding of the effects of the radio show.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||And legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case .||Over 50 witnesses , mostly students , were interviewed .||The first sentence states that legal authorities initiated a thorough investigation, likened to one for a murder case. The second sentence provides additional detail about the scope and nature of this investigation by mentioning that over 50 witnesses, primarily students, were interviewed. This further elaborates on the extent of the investigation described in the first sentence, hence the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||that carried the school 's familiar red-and-white GHS logo on the front||On the back , the shirts read , `` We have all the answers . ''||The first sentence describes the front of the shirts, noting the presence of the school's familiar red-and-white GHS logo. The second sentence expands on the description of the shirts by detailing what is written on the back of the shirts. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence adds more information to the initial description of the shirts, providing a fuller picture of their appearance.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin .||She did a lot of harm||The first sentence states that many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin. The second sentence provides a reason for their anger: she did a lot of harm. Therefore, the anger expressed in the first sentence is contingent upon the action described in the second sentence. The reason (doing a lot of harm) explains why her colleagues are angry, establishing a contingent relationship between the two sentences.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||She did a lot of harm||and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us . ''||The first sentence states that "she" did a lot of harm.The second sentence explains the consequence of her actions: they cast unfair aspersions on everyone. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the second sentence is dependent on the first; the unfair aspersions are a direct result of the harm caused. Thus, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, as it explains an effect that follows from the harm mentioned.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores||The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms||The first sentence states that the incident raises questions about using standardized test scores for evaluation. The second sentence introduces "The incentive pay thing" as having "opened up a can of worms," which likely refers to a problematic situation or unforeseen issues. This sentence expands on the problems mentioned in the first sentence by specifying one aspect of the issue: the incentive pay system related to standardized tests. It provides additional context or elaboration on the broader problem of using standardized tests for evaluations.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms||There may be others doing what she did . ''||The first sentence indicates that the incentive pay issue has caused significant problems or complications. The second sentence suggests a potential consequence of this situation: there may be other individuals engaging in similar actions. The possibility of others behaving like "she" did seems to arise from the complications caused by the incentive pay issue, thus establishing a contingent relationship between the two sentences.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Mrs. Ward , for one , was relieved .||Despite the strong evidence against Mrs. Yeargin , popular sentiment was so strong in her favor that `` I 'm afraid a jury would n't have convicted her .||The first sentence indicates that Mrs. Ward felt relief about something. The second sentence explains a reason for this relief: there was strong public support for Mrs. Yeargin, which likely meant she wouldn't be convicted by a jury. Thus, the relief experienced by Mrs. Ward (first sentence) is contingent upon the public sentiment and its potential impact on a jury's decision (second sentence). The relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the feeling of relief depends on the perceived outcome due to public opinion.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Since chalk first touched slate , schoolchildren have wanted to know : What 's on the test ?||These days , students can often find the answer in test-coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests .||The first sentence introduces the timeless desire of schoolchildren to know what will be on a test.The second sentence discusses a modern method for students to potentially gain insight into the content of standardized tests: through test-coaching materials provided by teachers. The comparison lies in contrasting the enduring student curiosity about test content with a contemporary way to address or exploit that curiosity. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of comparison, highlighting how the fundamental question "What's on the test?" persists over time but the methods for addressing it have evolved.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Worksheets in a test-practice kit called Learning Materials , sold to schools across the country by Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. , contain the same questions .||In many other instances , there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials .||The first sentence states that worksheets in a test-practice kit named "Learning Materials," distributed nationwide by Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co., include identical questions. The second sentence further elaborates by noting that, in numerous cases, there is virtually no distinction between the actual test and the "Learning Materials." This shows an expansion of the idea presented in the first sentence, providing additional detail about the similarity between the practice materials and the real test.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||If I took these preparation booklets into my classroom , I 'd have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it was n't cheating||such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests , which is to gauge learning progress||The first sentence states the speaker would struggle to justify using preparation booklets in class without seeming to cheat. The second sentence explains why such justification would be difficult: using coaching aids may undermine the goal of standardized tests, which is assessing learning progress. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by providing the reason why using the preparation booklets could be considered as compromising the integrity of standardized testing.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Sales figures of the test-prep materials are n't known , but their reach into schools is significant .||In Arizona , California , Florida , Louisiana , Maryland , New Jersey , South Carolina and Texas , educators say they are common classroom tools .||The first sentence states that while sales figures for test-prep materials are unknown, their presence in schools is significant. The second sentence then provides specific examples of this presence by listing several states where educators report the materials being commonly used in classrooms. This detailed information expands on the initial claim of the materials' significant reach, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||About 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers ' binders have also been sold in the past four years .||The materials in each set reach about 90 students .||The first sentence states that approximately 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teacher's binders have been sold over four years. The second sentence provides additional information about the impact of these materials, specifying that each set reaches about 90 students. The second sentence expands on the first by giving more detail about the scope or effect of the sales mentioned in the first sentence. Specifically, it explains the extent of student reach per set, thus expanding our understanding of the initial statement.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||He also asserted that exact questions were n't replicated .||When referred to the questions that matched , he said it was coincidental .||The first sentence states that "he" (the subject) asserted that exact questions weren't replicated. The second sentence then describes a subsequent event where "he" explains that any matching questions were coincidental. The temporal relationship is evident because the second event (explaining the coincidence of matching questions) happens after the initial assertion (stating that exact questions weren't replicated). Thus, there is a temporal sequence between the two events.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||But Learning Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills .||Scoring High matched on 64.5 .||The first sentence states that Learning Materials matched 66.5 out of 69 subskills. The second sentence provides additional information by specifying the match score for Scoring High, which is 64.5. This additional detail expands upon the context of matching subskills by including another subject's (Scoring High's) performance. Therefore, the relationship is one of expansion, where more data points are added to the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||that Messrs. Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring `` the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format||authors of Scoring High `` scrupulously avoid '' replicating exact questions||The first sentence states that Messrs. Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring the need for students to become familiar with tests and testing formats. The second sentence expands on this point by specifying one way in which they do so: the authors "scrupulously avoid" replicating exact questions. This means they deliberately refrain from including questions that exactly match those found on actual tests, further illustrating how they ignore the need for students to get familiar with test content and format. Thus, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first by providing a specific example of how Messrs. Kaminski and Mehrens ignore student needs.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||When Scoring High first came out in 1979 , it was a publication of Random House .||McGraw-Hill was outraged .||The first sentence states that when Scoring High was initially published in 1979, it was published by Random House. The second sentence mentions that McGraw-Hill was outraged. The contingency relationship here indicates that McGraw-Hill's outrage was contingent upon or triggered by the fact that Random House published Scoring High. McGraw-Hill's reaction (being outraged) is a consequence of the initial publication by Random House.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||McGraw-Hill was outraged .||In a 1985 advisory to educators , McGraw-Hill said Scoring High should n't be used because it represented a `` parallel form '' of the CAT and CTBS tests .||The first sentence indicates that McGraw-Hill felt a strong negative emotion (outrage).The second sentence provides context for this emotion by describing an action taken by McGraw-Hill in 1985: they advised educators not to use Scoring High because it was considered a "parallel form" of their CAT and CTBS tests. This advisory can be seen as a response to whatever provoked their outrage, suggesting that the action (the advisory) is contingent upon the emotion (outrage). The relationship between the sentences is thus one of contingency, where the second sentence explains an action taken due to the emotion expressed in the first sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||But in 1988 , McGraw-Hill purchased the Random House unit that publishes Scoring High , .||they are unaware of any efforts by McGraw-Hill to modify or discontinue Scoring High||The first sentence states that McGraw-Hill bought the Random House unit which publishes Scoring High in 1988. The second sentence discusses the lack of changes to Scoring High by McGraw-Hill after the acquisition. The comparison relationship here is implied: the purchase of the publishing unit is compared with the lack of subsequent changes to Scoring High by McGraw-Hill. In other words, the fact that there were no attempts to modify or discontinue the publication after the acquisition is being compared to the significant action of purchasing the unit that publishes it.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research `` should be continued indefinitely||the ban wo n't stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that does n't involve transplants||The first sentence states that the ban on federal funding for fetal-tissue transplant research should continue indefinitely. The second sentence explains that this ban will not impact privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that doesn't involve transplants. The second sentence expands on the implications of the ban described in the first sentence, providing additional context about what the continuation of the ban would not affect. This additional information clarifies and broadens the understanding of the scope and effects of the ban, thus creating an expansion relationship.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||The controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health , aware of the policy implications of its research , asked for an HHS review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson 's disease .||The department placed a moratorium on the research , pending a review of scientific , legal and ethical issues .||The first sentence outlines the start of a controversy in 1987, triggered by the NIH requesting an HHS review of its plan to use fetal tissue in a medical procedure. The second sentence details the subsequent action taken by the department, which was to place a moratorium on the research while reviewing various issues. The temporal relationship is established through the sequence of events: the request for review (first sentence) happened before the imposition of the moratorium (second sentence).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding .||The dispute has hampered the administration 's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control .||The first sentence states that the issue became involved in politics due to opposition from anti-abortion groups.The second sentence provides more detail about how this political involvement has affected the administration, specifically mentioning the hindrance in recruiting doctors for important positions at the NIH and CDC. This additional information expands on the consequences of the issue becoming embroiled in politics, illustrating how the political entanglement has impacted the administration's actions and goals. Therefore, the second sentence serves as an expansion of the first by detailing specific effects of the political involvement.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants .||Antonio Novello , , reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion .||The first sentence states that some candidates withdrew after being asked about their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants, suggesting that their views may have been a reason for withdrawal. The second sentence introduces Antonio Novello, who reportedly assured the administration of her opposition to abortion. The comparison relationship is established through the contrast between the candidates who withdrew and Novello's assurance of her stance, implying that Novello’s position aligns with what the administration prefers, unlike those who withdrew.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts||Earlier this week , Dr. Sullivan tried to defuse these charges .||The first sentence states that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific positions. The second sentence mentions that Dr. Sullivan attempted to defuse these accusations earlier in the week. While both sentences discuss the topic of accusations or actions related to scientific posts, they do not directly compare or contrast each other. Neither sentence serves as a cause for the other, nor does one provide elaboration or entailment of the other. Therefore, a comparison relationship does not accurately describe their connection. A more suitable relationship might focus on how the events or statements relate temporally or in terms of contingency.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||But the administration 's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists .||When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground , there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications||The first sentence indicates that the administration's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue causes disturbance among many scientists. The second sentence expresses a general principle that when scientific progress enters uncharted territory, society should have a role in judging its applications. The contingency relationship is established because the need for societal judgment (second sentence) is contingent upon scientific progress entering uncharted territory (as seen in the first sentence with the controversial fetal-tissue transplant issue). The principle expressed in the second sentence applies directly to the situation described in the first sentence, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||that Dr. Mason 's ruling may discourage private funding||The unavailability of federal funds , and the climate in which the decision was made , certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support||The first sentence indicates a potential consequence of Dr. Mason's ruling: it may discourage private funding. The second sentence discusses other factors—the unavailability of federal funds and the climate surrounding the decision—that also discourage support from visible foundations. The relationship is contingent because the second sentence provides additional conditions or factors that contribute to the same outcome (discouraging funding) as the one mentioned in the first sentence. It explains further circumstances that align with and possibly compound the effect of Dr. Mason's ruling.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Despite the flap over transplants , federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts .||`` Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer '' or to regulate genes that cause Down 's syndrome , the leading cause of mental retardation , according to an NIH summary .||The first sentence indicates that federal funding for research involving fetal tissues will continue despite controversies around transplants. The second sentence explains one reason for continuing this research: the potential benefits, such as regenerating damaged tissues, turning off cancer-causing genes, or regulating genes linked to Down's syndrome. The potential outcomes of the research provide context for why the funding continues, even amidst controversy. Thus, the contingency relationship is established because the continuation of funding is contingent on the perceived value and potential benefits of the research.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Yesterday 's share turnover was well below the year 's daily average of 133.8 million .||In October , the busiest month of the year so far , daily volume averaged roughly 145 million shares .||The first sentence provides information about yesterday's share turnover being below the year's daily average of 133.8 million.The second sentence offers a comparison point by mentioning the daily volume in the busiest month, October, which averaged about 145 million shares.Both sentences provide data points that can be compared to understand the context of yesterday's share turnover relative to other periods. This establishes a comparative relationship between the two sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||But speculators , anticipating that Connecticut will approve a law permitting such interstate banking soon , immediately bid up shares of Connecticut banks on the news .||A lot of the stocks that have been under water finally saw a reason to uptick||The first sentence states that speculators, expecting Connecticut to approve a law allowing interstate banking, bid up shares of Connecticut banks. The second sentence explains the effect of this bidding: stocks that had been performing poorly (described as "under water") began to rise ("uptick"). The second sentence expands upon the first by providing additional detail about the outcome of the bidding activity mentioned in the first sentence. It further clarifies that the bidding led to an improvement in the performance of previously struggling bank stocks.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Northeast Bancorp also fared well because takeover stocks have returned to favor among investors||Another OTC bank stock involved in a buy-out deal , First Constitution Financial , was higher .||The first sentence states that Northeast Bancorp performed well due to the resurgence of interest in takeover stocks among investors. The second sentence introduces another instance of a similar situation: First Constitution Financial, another over-the-counter (OTC) bank stock involved in a buy-out deal, also saw an increase in value. This second sentence expands on the context established in the first sentence by providing an additional example of a bank stock benefiting from the same market conditions. The relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds more information to support the point made in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Another OTC bank stock involved in a buy-out deal , First Constitution Financial , was higher .||It rose 7/8 to 18 1/4 .||The first sentence states that First Constitution Financial, an OTC bank stock involved in a buy-out deal, was higher. The second sentence provides specific details about the increase: it rose 7/8 to 18 1/4. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more information about the rise mentioned in the first sentence, explaining exactly how much it rose by and to what value. This makes the relationship between the two sentences one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Among other Connecticut banks whose shares trade in the OTC market , Society for Savings Bancorp , based in Hartford , saw its stock rise 1 3/4 to 18 1/4 .||Centerbank added 5/8 to 8 3/4||The first sentence reports the trading activity of Society for Savings Bancorp, including its stock price increase. The second sentence mentions another bank, Centerbank, and its stock price increase. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence broadens the scope of information by adding details about another bank's stock performance in the same context (Connecticut banks trading in the OTC market). It provides additional examples of banks within the same category, illustrating a broader picture of the market trend.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Among other Connecticut banks whose shares trade in the OTC market , Society for Savings Bancorp , based in Hartford , saw its stock rise 1 3/4 to 18 1/4 . Centerbank added 5/8 to 8 3/4||shares of NESB , a New London-based bank holding company , rose 5/8 to 5 7/8||The first sentence provides information about the stock movements of two Connecticut banks, Society for Savings Bancorp and Centerbank, in the OTC market. The second sentence specifically details the stock movement of NESB, another bank in the same context (Connecticut banks trading in the OTC market). The second sentence expands on the information from the first by providing additional detail about another bank's stock performance in the same situation. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Among other banking issues , Pennview Savings Association leapt more than 44 % with a gain of 6 5/8 to 21 5/8 .||The Pennsylvania bank agreed to be acquired in a merger with Univest Corp. of Pennsylvania for $ 25.50 a share .||The first sentence states that Pennview Savings Association experienced a significant stock price increase. The second sentence provides information about the company agreeing to be acquired by Univest Corp. at a specific price per share. The contingency relationship is evident because the stock price jump (first sentence) can be reasonably explained by the announcement of the acquisition (second sentence). Thus, the acquisition agreement likely caused the stock price increase, making the relationship between the two sentences contingent.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The Pennsylvania bank agreed to be acquired in a merger with Univest Corp. of Pennsylvania for $ 25.50 a share .||Valley Federal Savings & Loan , a California thrift issue , gained 1 to 4 1/4 after reporting a third-quarter loss of $ 70.7 million after an $ 89.9 million pretax charge mostly related to its mobile home financing unit .||The first sentence discusses a specific financial event involving a Pennsylvania bank agreeing to a merger with Univest Corp. at a specified price per share. The second sentence details another financial event regarding Valley Federal Savings & Loan, a thrift institution in California, experiencing gains after reporting a loss. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence provides additional information about a different financial situation in the banking industry, broadening the context from a single merger to include market reactions to financial reports in the sector.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||the one-time charge substantially eliminates future losses associated with the unit||the company 's core business remains strong||The first sentence indicates that the one-time charge has effectively removed potential future losses related to a specific unit. The second sentence provides additional context about the company's overall status, mentioning that its core business is still robust. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence broadens the perspective by adding information about the strength of the company's core business, which complements the positive effect of the one-time charge mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Also on the takeover front , Jaguar 's ADRs rose 1/4 to 13 7/8 on turnover of 4.4 million .||Since the British auto maker became a takeover target last month , its ADRs have jumped about 78 % .||The first sentence states that Jaguar's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) rose by 1/4 to 13 7/8 with a turnover of 4.4 million shares, placing this movement within the context of recent takeover activity. The second sentence expands on this context by explaining that since Jaguar became a takeover target last month, its ADRs have increased in value by approximately 78%. This additional information provides a broader perspective on the stock's performance in relation to the takeover news, thus expanding the understanding of the situation described in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||After troubled Heritage Media proposed acquiring POP Radio in a stock swap , POP Radio 's shares tumbled 4 to 14 3/4 .||Heritage Media , which already owns about 51 % of POP Radio , proposed paying POP Radio shareholders with shares of a new class of Heritage Media preferred stock that would be convertible into four shares of Heritage Media 's common .||The first sentence states that following a proposal by Heritage Media to acquire POP Radio, POP Radio's shares fell. The second sentence expands on the details of the acquisition proposal, explaining that Heritage Media, which already owns about 51% of POP Radio, plans to pay POP Radio shareholders with shares of a new class of Heritage Media preferred stock that can be converted into four shares of Heritage Media's common stock. This additional information clarifies the nature of the acquisition proposal mentioned in the first sentence, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||Rally 's lost 1 3/4 to 21 3/4 .||it has redeemed its rights issued Monday under its shareholder rights plan||The first sentence states that Rally experienced a loss in value, dropping from 1 3/4 to 21 3/4.The second sentence provides additional context by explaining an action taken by Rally, specifically redeeming its rights issued under its shareholder rights plan on Monday. This information expands on the situation described in the first sentence by giving more detail about what Rally did in relation to its financial status. Thus, the second sentence expands the information given in the first one by providing further details about Rally's actions concerning its shareholder rights.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||it expects to post a `` significant '' loss for its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30||In the year-earlier period , SCI had net income of $ 4.8 million , or 23 cents a share , on revenue of $ 225.6 million .||The first sentence indicates an expectation of a "significant" loss for the current fiscal first quarter.The second sentence provides the financial results from the same quarter in the previous year, where the company had a net income of $4.8 million. The comparison relationship is established through contrasting the expected loss with the actual profit from the year-earlier period, highlighting the change in financial performance.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Attorneys have argued since 1985 , , that they can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their identities to be known .||Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent years , citing attorney-client privilege .||The first sentence states that attorneys have argued they cannot provide information about clients who do not want their identities known. The second sentence shows an action taken by many attorneys: returning incomplete forms to the IRS and citing attorney-client privilege. This action is contingent upon the argument mentioned in the first sentence. In other words, the reason for returning the forms and invoking attorney-client privilege is due to the argument that they cannot disclose client identities without consent. The contingency relationship is established because the action taken by the attorneys is directly related to and dependent on the initial argument about protecting client confidentiality.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent years , citing attorney-client privilege .||Until last week , the IRS rarely acted on the incomplete forms .||The first sentence states that many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS, citing attorney-client privilege. The second sentence discusses the IRS's handling of these incomplete forms, noting that until last week, the IRS rarely acted on them. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the actions of the attorneys (returning incomplete forms) with the IRS's response (rarely acting on them). Both sentences discuss the handling of incomplete forms but from different perspectives - the attorneys' submission and the IRS's subsequent actions or lack thereof.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||This form forces a lawyer to become , in effect , a witness against his client||The IRS is asking lawyers to red-flag a criminal problem to the government||The first sentence states that the form requires a lawyer to act as a witness against their client, implying a conflict of interest or duty. The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying what the IRS is asking lawyers to do: flagging potential criminal issues to the government. This further explains the nature of the "witness" role the lawyers are being forced into, which is essentially reporting on their clients to the IRS. Therefore, the second sentence provides additional detail to support the initial claim, making the relationship one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The American Bar Association 's House of Delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the IRS reporting requirement .||that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death||The first sentence states that the American Bar Association (ABA) passed a resolution condemning an IRS reporting requirement. The second sentence explains a reason for this condemnation by mentioning that the ABA's code of ethics prohibits lawyers from disclosing client information except under specific circumstances (a court order or to prevent a crime that could result in death). Therefore, the resolution to condemn the IRS reporting requirement is contingent upon the ethical obligations outlined in the ABA's code of ethics, specifically the prohibition against disclosing client information without proper cause.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||At that meeting the Justice Department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice .||IRS officials opposed the Justice Department 's moderate stance on the matter||The first sentence outlines the actions and assurances provided by the Justice Department regarding enforcement procedures for attorneys.The second sentence describes the opposition from IRS officials to the Justice Department's stance on the matter. The comparison is evident through the contrast between the moderate stance of the Justice Department and the opposing view of the IRS officials. Both entities are involved in the same issue but have different approaches, creating a comparative context.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now .||that Justice officials had n't any knowledge of the IRS 's actions in the last week||The first sentence indicates that someone declined to provide a reason for the letters being sent to lawyers at this point in time. The second sentence offers additional information that could explain the reason for not providing details: the Justice officials did not have any knowledge of the IRS's actions in the last week. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by providing context for the decision not to disclose the reason for sending the letters. It explains that there may not have been a specific reason known at the time due to lack of knowledge about recent IRS actions.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Pragmatic cause', 'because'] ||that if they provide information about clients , that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors||Prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business . But they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases .||The first sentence states the condition that if certain entities provide client information, it could swiftly reach prosecutors. The second sentence explains that while prosecutors typically require court permission to get tax returns, they've accessed 8300 forms without such permission. This shows that the information (from the 8300 forms) did indeed end up with prosecutors without formal court approval, which is a consequence of the initial condition being met. Therefore, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, illustrating how the feared outcome actually occurred.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||that the IRS was sending the letters to test the issue||In a number of recent cases , federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys ' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential .||The first sentence indicates that the IRS was sending letters for a specific purpose - to test an issue. The second sentence discusses federal courts' decisions on a related topic - the confidentiality of information regarding fees from clients. The contingency relationship is established because the courts' refusal to recognize the confidentiality of fee-related information could potentially impact the outcome or rationale behind the IRS's testing through the sent letters. The court's stance is a factor that may influence or be considered in the IRS's test, making the relationship between the sentences a contingent one.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Often , judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare , but not federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento , Calif .||On Tuesday , the judge called a news conference to say he was quitting effective Dec. 31 to join a San Francisco law firm .||The first sentence states that judges typically transition into private practice quietly. The second sentence contrasts this general behavior by providing an example of a judge, Raul A. Ramirez, who did not follow this pattern; instead, he announced his departure with a news conference. The comparison is drawn between the typical low-key transition of judges into private practice and Judge Ramirez's more public announcement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||it is unjust for judges to make what they do||`` Judges are not getting what they deserve .||The first sentence states that it is unjust for judges to make what they do, suggesting that there is some form of unfairness regarding their earnings or actions. The second sentence expands on this notion by specifying one aspect of the injustice: judges are not receiving appropriate compensation for their work. By saying "Judges are not getting what they deserve," the second sentence adds detail to the idea of injustice introduced in the first sentence, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Pragmatic cause', 'because'] ||`` Judges are not getting what they deserve .||You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants ... and nobody blinks an eye .||The first sentence states that judges are not receiving fair treatment.The second sentence compares this situation to other professions like ballplayers or accountants who do not receive similar attention when facing issues. The comparison in the second sentence serves to highlight the disparity or unfairness mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, as it provides additional context or contrast to further illustrate the point about judges not getting what they deserve.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants ... and nobody blinks an eye .||When you become a federal judge , all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum . ''||The first sentence describes the common perception or reaction towards the salaries of professional ballplayers or accountants, suggesting that people generally do not question or react strongly to their earnings. The second sentence contrasts this with the situation of federal judges, whose salaries are considered significantly lower (paltry) in comparison, leading to a different treatment or perception. The comparison highlights the disparity in public perception and the relative value placed on different professions, particularly when transitioning from other well-paid careers to a federal judgeship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||In his lawsuit , Mr. Trudeau says the strike illegally included Darkhorse , .||A spokesman for the guild said the union 's lawyers are reviewing the suit .||The first sentence introduces a lawsuit filed by Mr. Trudeau, claiming that the strike illegally involved Darkhorse.The second sentence adds information about the guild's response to the lawsuit, stating that their lawyers are reviewing it. This sentence expands upon the context of the lawsuit mentioned in the first sentence by providing the reaction from the opposing side (the guild). Thus, the second sentence offers additional details that expand the narrative around the lawsuit, establishing an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||the union 's lawyers are reviewing the suit||disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against Mr. Trudeau .||The first sentence states that the union's lawyers are reviewing the suit. The second sentence adds more context by mentioning that disciplinary proceedings are confidential and that there is no comment on whether any are being held against Mr. Trudeau. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence provides additional information related to the situation described in the first sentence, specifically regarding the confidentiality of disciplinary proceedings and the lack of comment on Mr. Trudeau's status. This additional detail helps to broaden the understanding of the situation without directly causing or following from the events in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||the harassment consists mainly of the guild 's year-long threats of disciplinary action||a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next Monday in New York||In the first sentence, the nature of the harassment is described, which includes ongoing threats of disciplinary action from the guild. The second sentence provides specific information about one instance of such disciplinary actions: a hearing scheduled for the upcoming Monday in New York. This detail expands on the type of disciplinary action mentioned in the first sentence, illustrating a particular example of the threats that have been ongoing. Thus, the second sentence expands on the information provided in the first sentence by giving a concrete example of the disciplinary action threatened.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next Monday in New York||the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified||The first sentence states that there is a guild disciplinary hearing scheduled for next Monday in New York. The second sentence expresses an opinion about the fairness of the proceedings and the justifications for any punishment from the guild. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the factual announcement of the hearing with a subjective view on its fairness and the legitimacy of potential outcomes. The sentences compare the actual event with a perspective on its appropriateness.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||Title X funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family-planning services , according to the opinion by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York .||that the restrictions do n't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services do n't violate the rights of pregnant women||The first sentence provides information about Title X funds being the largest source of federal funding for family-planning services, as noted by a court opinion. The second sentence further details aspects of that opinion, specifically mentioning that the restrictions do not violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services do not violate the rights of pregnant women. This additional information expands on the original statement about the court's opinion, providing more detail about what the opinion entails. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Dallas District Judge Jack Hampton had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last December , two weeks after sentencing an 18-year-old defendant to 30 years in state prison for killing two homosexual men in a city park .||The judge was quoted as referring to the victims as `` queers '' and saying they would n't have been killed `` if they had n't been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys . ''||The first sentence states that Judge Jack Hampton sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press. The second sentence provides details about those remarks: the judge referred to the victims as "queers" and suggested they wouldn't have been killed if they hadn't been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys. Thus, the second sentence expands on the content of the remarks mentioned in the first sentence, giving more information about what the judge said. This expansion helps to clarify the nature of the remarks that led to calls for a judicial inquiry.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||although he did violate the state 's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case||, '' concluded that he `` would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute '' as a victim .||The first part of the sentence notes a violation of the state's judicial code due to public comments on a pending case. The second part of the sentence discusses a conclusion about the individual's impartiality in cases involving specific victims. The comparison relationship is evident as the sentence contrasts the act of violating the judicial code with the assertion of impartiality in certain types of cases. This contrast serves to compare the behavior in one situation (public commenting) with the expected behavior in another (judging cases).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||A former member of the prosecution team in the Iran/Contra affair joined the Chicago firm of Mayer , Brown & Platt .||Michael R. Bromwich , a member since January 1987 of the three-lawyer trial team in the prosecution of Oliver North , became a partner in the Washington , D.C. , office of the 520-lawyer firm .||The first sentence states that a former member of the prosecution team in the Iran/Contra affair has joined a specific law firm. The second sentence provides more details about this individual, identifying him as Michael R. Bromwich, specifying his role during the prosecution of Oliver North, and noting when he joined the prosecution team. It also clarifies that he became a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of the same firm mentioned in the first sentence. This additional information expands upon the initial statement, providing a clearer picture of who the individual is and what his new position at the firm entails. Therefore, the relationship between these two sentences is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||But Fujitsu , Japan 's No. 1 computer maker , is n't alone .||it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987||The first sentence indicates that Fujitsu, despite being Japan's top computer maker, is not the only entity in its situation or market position. The second sentence details a specific action taken by Fujitsu: bidding one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987. The contingency relationship here is that the detail about Fujitsu's unique actions (bidding one yen in auctions) is provided to explain or support the idea that, despite its top position, it engages in specific strategies that others might also use. The action (bidding one yen) is contingent upon the context set by the first sentence (Fujitsu is not alone in its strategies).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987||In both cases , NEC lost the contract to Fujitsu , which made the same bid and won a tie-breaking lottery .||The first sentence states that NEC placed a bid of one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987. The second sentence expands on the outcome of those bids: NEC lost the contract to Fujitsu, which also bid one yen but won a tie-breaking lottery. The second sentence provides additional details about the results of the auctions mentioned in the first sentence, thus expanding on the initial information.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The Ministry of International Trade and Industry summoned executives from the companies to `` make sure they understood '' the concern about such practices , according to a government spokesman .||These cases lead to the loss of the firms ' social and international credibility||The first sentence indicates that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry took action by summoning executives to ensure they understood the concerns about certain practices. The second sentence discusses the consequence of such cases, which is the loss of social and international credibility for the firms. The contingency relationship is evident because the action taken by the Ministry (summoning executives) is contingent upon the issue of the firms potentially losing credibility due to concerning practices. The ministry's action aims to address the potential loss of credibility, making the relationship between the sentences one of contingency.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||We would like to apologize for having caused huge trouble||The bids were `` contrary to common sense . ''||The first sentence indicates an apology for causing huge trouble. The second sentence explains what specifically caused the trouble: the bids being "contrary to common sense." This provides additional information about the nature of the trouble, expanding on the initial statement. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more detail about the reason for the apology.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'although'] ||The fire is also fueled by growing international interest in Japanese behavior .||So far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue .||The first sentence discusses the increasing international interest in Japanese behavior as a factor contributing to a certain issue (the "fire"). The second sentence then contrasts this by mentioning the absence of any public overseas complaints about the same issue. These sentences form a comparison by highlighting the disparity between the growing interest and the lack of public complaints from overseas, suggesting that while interest is increasing, it has not yet translated into public criticism or complaints.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||that they have limited access to government procurement in Japan , in part because Japanese companies unfairly undercut them||Japanese companies of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers -- products Fujitsu and NEC make .||The first sentence states that there is limited access to government procurement for some parties due to Japanese companies unfairly undercutting them. The second sentence expands on this point by specifying how Japanese companies like Fujitsu and NEC, do this: through excessively slashing prices on products they manufacture, such as semiconductors and supercomputers. This detail provides additional information on the method used by Japanese companies to gain an unfair advantage, supporting the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||when the city of Hiroshima announced that Fujitsu won a contract to design a computer system to map its waterworks||The city had expected to pay about 11 million yen $ 77,000 , but Fujitsu essentially offered to do it for free .||The first sentence states that the city of Hiroshima awarded Fujitsu a contract to design a computer system for mapping its waterworks. The second sentence provides additional details about the financial aspect of the contract: the city's initial expectation to pay 11 million yen, and Fujitsu's decision to effectively provide the service for free. This additional information expands upon the initial statement about the contract, hence the expansion relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||it has offered to withdraw its bids in Hiroshima and Nagano||they have n't decided whether to try to force the company to go through with the contracts||The first sentence states that the company has offered to withdraw its bids in Hiroshima and Nagano.The second sentence discusses an undetermined decision about potentially forcing the company to honor the contracts. These sentences establish a comparison because they both deal with the company's bids and contracts but present different actions: one is the voluntary withdrawal proposed by the company, and the other is a potential forced execution of the contracts by another party. This comparison highlights the contrast between the company's willingness to withdraw and the possibility of being compelled to follow through with the contracts.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||they were still investigating , and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge||that headquarters had n't approved the bids , and that he did n't know about most of the cases until Wednesday||The first sentence states that investigations were ongoing and suggests the possibility of discovering additional unauthorized bids. The second sentence describes the speaker's lack of knowledge about the bids and when he became aware of most cases. The comparison lies in contrasting the ongoing nature of the investigation and the potential for new discoveries with the speaker's late awareness and lack of prior approval for these bids. Both sentences discuss the state of knowledge regarding the bids, setting up a comparison between what might be found and what was known.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||One yen is not ethical||`` Profit may be low , but at least costs should be covered .||The first sentence makes a claim about the unethic nature of "one yen".The second sentence suggests a condition where profit is not high, but costs are covered. The contingency relationship here indicates that the second sentence is providing a condition or context that may justify or explain the ethical stance taken in the first sentence. In other words, even though one yen may seem insufficient (and potentially unethical due to very low profit), the speaker accepts it as long as it covers the costs, implying that under those conditions, it might be acceptable or at least more understandable.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'although'] ||The $ 35.7 million net loss equals 86 cents a share .||Not counting the extraordinary charge it would have had a net loss of $ 3.1 million , or seven cents a share||The first sentence states the net loss including all charges, specifying the per-share impact. The second sentence presents an alternative scenario excluding an extraordinary charge, detailing the adjusted loss and its per-share effect. These two sentences form a comparison by showing the difference in financial outcomes with and without considering the extraordinary charge, highlighting how the charge affects the company's reported loss per share.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Not counting the extraordinary charge it would have had a net loss of $ 3.1 million , or seven cents a share||A year earlier , it had profit of $ 7.5 million , or 18 cents a share .||The first sentence presents the financial results for a recent period, indicating a net loss of $3.1 million after excluding an extraordinary charge. The second sentence provides the financial outcome from a year earlier, showing a net profit of $7.5 million. The comparison relationship is evident as the sentences contrast the company's financial performance over the two periods: a net loss in the recent period versus a net profit in the previous year. This comparison helps illustrate the change in the company's financial health over time.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||A year earlier , it had profit of $ 7.5 million , or 18 cents a share .||Revenue rose 42 % to $ 133.7 million from $ 94 million .||The first sentence provides information about the company's profit in the previous year, at $ 7.5 million or 18 cents a share. The second sentence details an increase in revenue, specifically a rise of 42% to $ 133.7 million from $ 94 million. These sentences exhibit an expansion relationship because the second sentence expands on the financial context provided by the first. It offers additional financial data (revenue increase) that contributes to a fuller understanding of the company's financial situation during the period in question, thus expanding on the initial information about profits.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||it was converting its Santa Clara , Calif. , factory to a research and development facility||A spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in force .||The first sentence states that a factory in Santa Clara, California, is being converted to a research and development facility. The second sentence mentions that a spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in the workforce. The comparison relationship is shown as follows: The first sentence provides information about a significant change in the factory's function, while the second sentence contrasts this by highlighting the absence of specific details regarding the potential impact on employment. This comparison underscores the difference between the announced change and the uncertainty regarding its consequences.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||This is a company that has invested in capacity additions more aggressively than any other company in the industry and now the industry is growing more slowly and they are suddenly poorly positioned||`` I think the stock is dead money for a while . ''||The first sentence outlines a situation where a company has invested heavily in capacity but now faces slower industry growth, leaving it poorly positioned. The second sentence expresses an opinion that the stock will not perform well for some time. The opinion in the second sentence is contingent upon the situation described in the first sentence: the poor positioning of the company due to its aggressive investments and the subsequent slow industry growth. The speaker believes the stock will not yield good returns ("dead money") as a result of the company's current situation.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||U.S. chip makers are facing continued slack demand following a traditionally slow summer .||that chip buyers are keeping inventories low because of jitters about the course of the U.S. economy||The first sentence indicates that U.S. chip makers are experiencing weak demand after a typically slow summer period.The second sentence explains one reason for this situation: chip buyers are maintaining low inventories due to uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy. The contingency relationship is established because the weak demand faced by chip makers is contingent upon the behavior of chip buyers, who are keeping inventories low out of concern for economic conditions.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Dollar-yen trade is the driving force in the market but I 'm not convinced it will continue .||Who knows what will happen down the road , in three to six months , if foreign investment starts to erode ? ''||The first sentence expresses uncertainty about whether dollar-yen trade will remain the driving force in the market.The second sentence introduces a potential future scenario: the erosion of foreign investment and questions its impact on the situation. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the speaker's uncertainty and the speculative nature of the second sentence, suggesting that the continuation of dollar-yen trade as the dominant factor is contingent upon what happens with foreign investment in the coming months.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8500 marks , up from 1.8415 marks late Tuesday , and at 143.80 yen , up from 142.85 yen late Tuesday .||Sterling was quoted at $ 1.5755 , down from $ 1.5805 late Tuesday .||The first sentence provides information about the exchange rates of the dollar against the mark and the yen. The second sentence gives additional information about the exchange rate of sterling against the dollar. Although they both present different currency exchanges, they share a common context: the late trading rates compared to those of the previous day. The second sentence expands the information by including another currency pair, providing a broader picture of the foreign exchange market.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||He contends that the perception in Japan of a vitriolic U.S. response to Sony Corp. 's announcement of its purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. has been temporarily mollified .||He cites the recent deal between the Mitsubishi Estate Co. and the Rockefeller Group , as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed Japanese company in the Georgia-Pacific Corp. takeover bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. as evidence .||In the first sentence, the subject (presumably "he") argues that the perception in Japan regarding a strong U.S. reaction to Sony's acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment has been softened for the moment. The second sentence provides specific examples to support this argument: the Mitsubishi Estate Co.'s deal with the Rockefeller Group and a potential involvement of a Japanese firm in a takeover bid. These instances serve to expand upon and provide evidence for the claim made in the first sentence, thus establishing an expansion relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'although'] ||But some of the TV stations that bought `` Cosby '' reruns for record prices two years ago are n't laughing much these days .||The reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows .||The first sentence indicates that certain TV stations, which paid high prices for "Cosby" reruns, are now experiencing dissatisfaction or regret. The second sentence contrasts this situation by stating that the reruns have actually improved ratings for many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that broadcast them. The comparison relationship is evident as the second sentence presents a different outcome (positive ratings impact) for a group of stations compared to the initial group's negative experience.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||it 's using pressure tactics||We 're willing to negotiate||The first sentence states that "pressure tactics" are being used. The second sentence adds more context by specifying who is using these tactics: "We're willing to negotiate." This shows that the speaker is part of the group applying pressure and is open to negotiation. The second sentence expands on the first by providing additional information about the stance or intentions of the party using pressure tactics.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||We 're willing to negotiate||`` We 're offering this plan now because we feel it 's the right time . ''||The first sentence states that the speaker is willing to negotiate.The second sentence explains that they are offering a plan because they believe it is the right time.Both sentences express openness and a sense of appropriate timing for discussion or action, suggesting a comparison between being willing to negotiate and offering the plan at what is perceived as the right moment. The comparison lies in the similar attitude toward taking action (negotiating or offering a plan) at a suitable juncture.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Viacom 's move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks .||he believes Viacom 's move is a `` pre-emptive strike ''||The first sentence indicates that Viacom made a move at a specific time: when the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies still running on networks. The second sentence explains that someone believes this move by Viacom is a "pre-emptive strike." This belief is contingent upon the context provided by the first sentence, specifically the timing of Viacom's move. The person's belief that Viacom's move is a pre-emptive strike is based on the fact that the syndication market is currently being flooded with situation comedies, suggesting that Viacom's action is a strategic response to the current market conditions.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'indeed'] ||because the company is worried that `` Cosby '' ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years||`` Cosby '' is down a full ratings point in the week of Oct. 2-8 over the same week a year ago , according to A.C. Nielsen Co .||The first sentence states that the company is worried about declining ratings for "Cosby" in syndication over the next few years. The second sentence provides specific data supporting this worry: "Cosby" lost a full rating point in one week compared to the same week the previous year, according to Nielsen ratings. The second sentence expands on the first by providing evidence (the drop in ratings) that supports the company's concern.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||the show has `` been a major disappointment to us||`` At the prices we were charged , there should have been some return for the dollar .||The first sentence indicates dissatisfaction with the show, described as a "major disappointment." The second sentence explains a reason for this disappointment: the high prices charged and the lack of value received in return. Thus, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, as the high cost and lack of return on investment justify the expressed disappointment. The relationship shows that the level of disappointment is contingent on the perceived value for the money spent.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||, Garbage made its debut this fall with the promise to give consumers the straight scoop on the U.S. waste crisis .||The magazine combines how-to pieces on topics like backyard composting , explanatory essays on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet , and hard-hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders .||The first sentence introduces Garbage magazine and its purpose to provide information on the U.S. waste crisis. The second sentence expands on the type of content the magazine offers, including how-to articles, explanatory essays, and hard-hitting pieces related to environmental issues.

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate America 's good guys and bad boys .||In one feature , called `` In the Dumpster , '' editors point out a product they deem to be a particularly bad offender .||The first sentence states that the editors have invested significant effort into investigating products at supermarkets to distinguish between ethically positive and negative companies. The second sentence elaborates on this process by providing an example of how the editors carry out their mission: by singling out specific products they consider unethical in a segment titled "In the Dumpster." This detail expands upon the initial statement about the editors' efforts, hence the expansion relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||In one feature , called `` In the Dumpster , '' editors point out a product they deem to be a particularly bad offender .||From an advertising standpoint , the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days .||The first sentence describes a feature where editors criticize products they consider poor. The second sentence discusses the issue from an advertising perspective, noting that the criticized products may belong to significant magazine advertisers. These sentences establish a comparison by contrasting the editorial critique with the commercial interests of the magazine. The relationship highlights the tension between editorial integrity and advertising revenue, as both involve evaluating the same products but from different viewpoints.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Campbell Soup , for one , is furious its Souper Combo microwave product was chastised in the premiere `` In the Dumpster '' column .||The magazine 's editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging 's polystyrene foam , polyproplene and polyester film -- all plastic items they say are non-biodegradable .||The first sentence states that Campbell Soup is upset about the criticism its Souper Combo microwave product received in a magazine column. The second sentence expands on this criticism by providing details about the magazine's coverage of the product, specifically mentioning the use of a diagram highlighting the non-biodegradable materials in the packaging. This detail adds more information about the nature of the criticism, thus expanding on the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The magazine 's editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging 's polystyrene foam , polyproplene and polyester film -- all plastic items they say are non-biodegradable .||It 's precisely the kind of product that 's created the municipal landfill monster||The first sentence states that the magazine's editors published a large diagram of the product, highlighting its non-biodegradable plastic components. The second sentence explains the significance of these non-biodegradable components by stating that they are the type of materials that contribute to the creation of municipal landfills. The second sentence expands on the first by providing additional context about why the non-biodegradability of the product is important or problematic. It further explains the potential environmental impact of products like the one featured in the diagram.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||I think that this magazine is not only called Garbage , but it is practicing journalistic garbage||Campbell was n't even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment||In the first sentence, the speaker criticizes the magazine, stating that its name and content are both 'garbage.' The second sentence provides additional context to support the criticism: it mentions that Campbell, presumably a subject of the magazine's reporting, was not contacted for comment. This detail expands on the initial criticism by showing an example of poor journalistic practice, which further justifies the speaker's negative assessment of the magazine. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Campbell was n't even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment||Modifications had been made to the Souper Combo product at the time the issue was printed making it less an offender than was portrayed .||The first sentence states that Campbell was not contacted by the magazine for a chance to comment. The second sentence provides additional context by explaining modifications to the Souper Combo product at the time the issue was published, suggesting the product was less problematic than depicted. The second sentence expands on the situation by giving more detail about the circumstances surrounding the magazine's portrayal of the product and why Campbell's input could have been relevant.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off Madison Avenue 's big spenders .||You really need the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine if you 're going to make a run of it||The first sentence indicates uncertainty about whether a new magazine can afford to lose interest from major advertisers, referred to here as "Madison Avenue's big spenders." The second sentence explains the necessity of having significant advertisers, like "the Campbell Soups of the world," interested in the magazine for it to succeed. The contingency relationship is established through the dependency of the magazine's success on the interest of major advertisers. The second sentence is contingent upon the situation presented in the first, explaining what is required ("you really need") for the magazine to overcome the potential risk mentioned.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||You really need the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine if you 're going to make a run of it||The economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base '' of big-time ad spenders||The first sentence states the necessity of having major advertisers like Campbell Soup interested in the magazine for its success. The second sentence explains that the financial aspects of publishing magazines typically demand a strong foundation of significant advertisers. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the dependency of the magazine's success (as mentioned in the first sentence) on having a solid base of big-time advertisers (explained in the second sentence). The success of the magazine, as implied in the first sentence, is contingent upon securing major advertisers, as detailed in the second sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||its ad in the premiere issue was a one-time purchase , and it does n't have any plans to advertise in future issues||We do n't spend much on print advertising||The first sentence states that the ad in the premiere issue was a one-time purchase and there are no plans for future ads. The second sentence explains a reason for this behavior: the company does not spend much on print advertising. The second sentence expands on the first by providing context for why the ad was a one-time purchase and why there are no plans for future ads, hence the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||According to Ms. Poore , Old-House Journal Corp. , her publishing company , printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue .||The first and second issues sold out on newsstands||The first sentence states that Ms. Poore's publishing company printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue. The second sentence expands on this information by specifying that both the first and second issues sold out on newsstands. The second sentence provides additional detail about the sales success mentioned in the first sentence, indicating that the expansion of the information pertains to the extent of the success, including the second issue.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||its television programming operations agreed to supply more than 4,000 hours of original programming across Europe in 1990||the programs , largely game shows , will be provided by its E.C. Television unit along with Fremantle International , a producer and distributor of game shows of which it recently bought 49 %||The first sentence states that the company's television programming operations committed to supplying over 4,000 hours of original programming in Europe in 1990. The second sentence expands on this commitment by specifying what type of programming (largely game shows) will be provided and by whom (its E.C. Television unit and Fremantle International, a company in which it recently acquired a 49% stake). This additional detail provides context and elaboration on the initial statement, explaining how the commitment will be fulfilled and involving which parties, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||the programs , largely game shows , will be provided by its E.C. Television unit along with Fremantle International , a producer and distributor of game shows of which it recently bought 49 %||that volume makes it the largest supplier of original TV programming in Europe||The first sentence states that the programs, primarily game shows, will be supplied by the company's E.C. Television unit in conjunction with Fremantle International, a game show producer and distributor in which the company has recently acquired a 49% stake. The second sentence provides additional information about the significance of this volume, specifying that this volume makes the company the largest supplier of original TV programming in Europe. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more detail about the scale and impact of the programming supply.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||that volume makes it the largest supplier of original TV programming in Europe||Interpublic is providing the programming in return for advertising time , .||The first sentence states that "it" (referring to an unspecified entity in this context) is the largest supplier of original TV programming in Europe due to its volume. The second sentence mentions that Interpublic is providing programming in exchange for advertising time. The comparison relationship is implied but not directly stated between the two sentences. Since there's no direct comparison, we can infer that the relationship is intended to highlight the method by which programming is supplied (in return for advertising time). However, the specific comparison aspect isn't clearly demonstrated in these sentences. A direct comparison would require more explicit information linking the size or method of one entity to another in terms of supplying programming.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'previously'] ||CoreStates Financial Corp. , Philadelphia , named Earle Palmer Brown & Spiro , Philadelphia , as agency of record for its $ 5 million account .||The business had been handled by VanSant Dugdale , Baltimore .||The first sentence states that CoreStates Financial Corp. has named Earle Palmer Brown & Spiro as the new agency of record for its $5 million account. The second sentence informs us that the business was previously handled by VanSant Dugdale. The temporal relationship here indicates a sequence of events: the business was initially managed by VanSant Dugdale, and then it transitioned to Earle Palmer Brown & Spiro. This shows a change over time, with one agency being replaced by another.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'first'] ||The move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns , Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC .||In May , the two companies , through their jointly owned holding company , Temple , offered $ 50 a share , or $ 777 million , for Sea Containers .||The first sentence states that the move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC. The second sentence provides additional details about the takeover attempt, specifying that the offer was made in May through their jointly owned holding company, Temple, and it was for $50 a share, totaling $777 million. This additional information expands on the original statement about the takeover attempt, explaining when the offer was made, how it was structured, and the financial terms involved. Therefore, the relationship between these two sentences is Expansion.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||In May , the two companies , through their jointly owned holding company , Temple , offered $ 50 a share , or $ 777 million , for Sea Containers .||In August , Temple sweetened the offer to $ 63 a share , or $ 963 million .||The first sentence outlines an initial event where the two companies made an offer of $50 a share for Sea Containers in May. The second sentence then describes a subsequent event where the offer was increased to $63 a share in August. The relationship is temporal because the second event (the increase in the offer) clearly occurs after the first event (the original offer). The sequence of events is defined by the months mentioned (May followed by August).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||That $ 130 million `` gives us some flexibility in case Temple raises its bid .||We are able to increase our price above the $ 70 level if necessary .||The first sentence states that the possession of $130 million provides some flexibility in case Temple raises its bid. The second sentence expands on what this flexibility means: specifically, it allows for increasing the price above the $70 level if needed. The second sentence provides additional detail about the flexibility mentioned in the first sentence, explaining how this financial buffer can be used. Thus, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first one.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||reaction to Sea Containers ' proposal has been `` very positive||In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Sea Containers closed at $ 62.625 , up 62.5 cents .||The first sentence states that the reaction to Sea Containers' proposal has been very positive. The second sentence provides specific evidence of this positive reaction through the company's stock performance: Sea Containers' stock price increased by 62.5 cents, closing at $62.625. The second sentence expands on the first by giving concrete details about the positive market response to the proposal.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||It also issued a final rule requiring auto makers to equip light trucks and minivans with lap-shoulder belts for rear seats beginning in the 1992 model year .||Such belts already are required for the vehicles ' front seats .||The first sentence states that a final rule was issued, requiring auto makers to equip light trucks and minivans with lap-shoulder belts for rear seats starting from the 1992 model year. The second sentence adds information by specifying that such belts are already required for the vehicles' front seats. The second sentence expands on the context of the regulation by providing additional details about existing requirements for front seats, thus giving more background or supplementary information about seat belt requirements.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||the department for years to extend car-safety requirements to light trucks and vans , which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the U.S. .||that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars||The first sentence indicates that there has been an effort to extend car safety requirements to light trucks and vans due to their growing share of vehicle sales in the U.S. The second sentence provides a reason for this extension, which is that many vehicles classified as commercial light trucks are used primarily to carry people rather than cargo. Thus, the second sentence explains a condition that justifies the action described in the first sentence (the contingency), namely, that if light trucks are being used like cars, they should have similar safety features.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||But now , there seems to be a fairly systematic effort to address the problem||`` We 're in a very different regulatory environment . ''||The first sentence indicates that there is a systematic effort to address a certain problem. The second sentence provides additional context about the current situation, mentioning that they are in a "very different regulatory environment." This additional information expands upon the context for the systematic effort mentioned in the first sentence, suggesting that the change in the regulatory environment may be a contributing factor to the new approach being taken. Thus, the second sentence adds more detail to help explain the circumstances surrounding the systematic effort, which establishes the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light-truck deaths||We could prevent many of these fatalities with minimum roof-crush standards||The first sentence states that rollover crashes cause nearly half of all light-truck fatalities. The second sentence proposes a preventative measure: implementing minimum roof-crush standards to reduce these fatalities. The second sentence expands upon the first by suggesting a specific solution to address the issue of high fatality rates in rollover crashes. It further elaborates on the problem introduced in the first sentence by offering a potential way to mitigate the fatalities.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The roofs would be required to withstand a force of 1.5 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle .||During the test , the roof could n't be depressed more than five inches .||The first sentence outlines a requirement for the roofs - they must withstand a force of 1.5 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle. The second sentence provides a specific detail about how this requirement is operationalized during a test: the roof cannot be depressed more than five inches. This detail explains or expands upon the standard set in the first sentence, specifying what "withstand" means in practical terms. Therefore, the second sentence offers additional information that expands on the initial requirement, establishing an expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||the company currently has no rear-seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks , but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year||Chrysler fully expects to have them installed across its light-truck line by the Sept. 1 , 1991 , deadline||The first sentence indicates that the company does not currently have rear-seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks but plans to start installing them by the end of the 1990 model year. The second sentence states that Chrysler anticipates having these safety features installed in all its light trucks by September 1, 1991. The contingency relationship is evident because the plan to phase in the belts by the end of the 1990 model year is contingent upon meeting the deadline of September 1, 1991, for full implementation across the light-truck line. The second sentence's expectation is dependent on the successful execution of the plan mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||Chrysler fully expects to have them installed across its light-truck line by the Sept. 1 , 1991 , deadline||its trucks and vans already meet the roof-crush resistance standard for cars||The first sentence states that Chrysler anticipates meeting a deadline for installing certain features across its light-truck line by a specific date. The second sentence provides additional context by specifying that Chrysler's trucks and vans already comply with a particular safety standard (roof-crush resistance) that applies to cars. This additional information expands upon Chrysler's preparedness and compliance status, thereby providing more detail about its ability to meet the deadline mentioned in the first sentence. The relationship is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds supportive information to the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Ford trucks have met car standards for roof-crush resistance since 1982||Ford began installing the rear-seat belts in trucks with its F-series Crew Cab pickups in the 1989 model year .||The first sentence states that Ford trucks have met car standards for roof-crush resistance since 1982. The second sentence provides additional information about Ford's safety measures in trucks, specifically mentioning the installation of rear-seat belts in certain models starting from the 1989 model year. This additional detail expands on Ford's commitment to safety in their trucks, complementing the initial statement about meeting safety standards. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds more context or detail to the subject of Ford's adherence to safety standards.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||The discussions were disclosed as the bank holding company said that it has dropped its longstanding opposition to full interstate banking bills in Connecticut and in Massachusetts .||Later yesterday , a Massachusetts senate committee approved a bill to allow national interstate banking by banks in the state beginning in 1991 .||The first sentence states that the bank holding company has dropped its opposition to full interstate banking bills in Massachusetts. The second sentence tells us that a Massachusetts senate committee approved a bill for national interstate banking by banks in the state starting in 1991. The temporal relationship here is indicated by the sequence of events: the bank holding company changing its position came before the senate committee's approval of the bill. This sequence shows a temporal connection where one event (the change in stance by the bank holding company) precedes another (the senate committee's approval).
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||We have , and I 'm sure others have , considered what our options are , and we 've had conversations with people who in the future might prove to be interesting partners . ''||There 's nothing very hot||The first sentence indicates that discussions with potential partners have taken place. The second sentence suggests that there isn't anything particularly exciting or urgent at present. The comparison relationship is evident because the speaker contrasts the ongoing discussions with the lack of immediate, compelling opportunities, implying that while they've engaged with potential partners, none of these prospects are currently 'very hot' or highly promising. This contrast serves to evaluate the current state of these discussions.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Bank of New England has been hit hard by the region 's real-estate slump , with its net income declining 42 % to $ 121.6 million , or 61 cents a share , in the first nine months of 1989 from the year-earlier period .||it would sell some operations and lay off 4 % of its work force ,||The first sentence indicates that the Bank of New England experienced a significant decline in net income due to the regional real-estate slump. The second sentence describes actions the bank plans to take: selling some operations and laying off part of its workforce. These actions are likely responses to the financial difficulties mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the latter actions are taken in response to the former situation.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||it would sell some operations and lay off 4 % of its work force ,||It recently signed a preliminary agreement to negotiate exclusively with the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. for the sale of part of its leasing business to the Japanese bank .||The first sentence states that the company plans to sell some operations and reduce its workforce by 4%.

This comparison highlights the shift from profitability to a loss, explaining the reason for the dividend cut.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||it has redeemed its rights outstanding issued Monday in its shareholder rights plan||holders of stock of record Nov. 10 will receive 1/10th of one cent a share as the redemption payment||The first sentence states that the company has redeemed its rights outstanding issued on Monday under its shareholder rights plan. The second sentence provides more specific details about the redemption process: who is eligible (holders of stock of record on Nov. 10) and what they will receive (1/10th of one cent per share). This additional information expands upon the initial statement about the redemption, explaining how it affects shareholders and what the terms of the redemption are. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||When Warren Winiarski , proprietor of Stag 's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley , announced a $ 75 price tag for his 1985 Cask 23 Cabernet this fall , few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked .||This is the peak of my wine-making experience||The first sentence states that Warren Winiarski set a high price ($75) for his 1985 Cask 23 Cabernet and that there was little resistance to this price from wine shops and restaurants. The second sentence expresses Winiarski's personal view of the wine as the peak of his wine-making experience. The second sentence can be seen as providing a reason for the pricing decision and lack of resistance: if the wine is considered the peak of the winemaker's experience, it could justify a premium price and reduce resistance from buyers. Thus, Winiarski's high valuation of the wine contingently explains the high price and the lack of pushback.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||It is in my estimation the best wine Stag 's Leap has produced , and with fewer than 700 cases available , it is sure to sell quickly .||The price is a new high for California Cabernet Sauvignon , but it is not the highest .||The first sentence states the opinion that a specific wine from Stag's Leap is the best they've produced and notes its limited availability, predicting quick sales. The second sentence discusses the price of this wine, mentioning that it sets a new high for California Cabernet Sauvignon but isn't the most expensive overall. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence adds more detail about the wine's pricing context, which is relevant to understanding why it might sell quickly due to its perceived value and quality at that price point.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Pragmatic cause', 'because'] ||The price is a new high for California Cabernet Sauvignon , but it is not the highest .||Diamond Creek 1985 Lake Vineyard Cabernet weighed in this fall with a sticker price of $ 100 a bottle .||The first sentence states that the price is a new high for California Cabernet Sauvignon, but also clarifies that it is not the highest price ever. The second sentence introduces an instance where a specific wine, Diamond Creek 1985 Lake Vineyard Cabernet, was priced at $100 a bottle. This information helps to contextualize the claim made in the first sentence that the current price, while a new high, is not the absolute highest. The mention of the Diamond Creek wine's price serves to provide an example of a higher price, thus contingently supporting the claim that there have been more expensive wines in the past.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||In the last year or so , however , this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members .||The classics have zoomed in price to meet the competition||The first sentence indicates that an exclusive club, presumably referring to a group of classic or prestigious items, has recently admitted many new flashy members. The second sentence explains that the classics have significantly increased in price to compete, likely due to the influx of new members and possibly to maintain their status or value in the face of this change. The expansion of the club with new members is the reason for the classics' price increase, showing an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||France can boast the lion 's share of high-priced bottles .||Bordeaux 's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $ 60 to $ 80 each except for the smallest in terms of production , Chateau Petrus , .||The first sentence makes a general claim that France has a significant number of high-priced wine bottles.The second sentence provides specific examples of these high-priced bottles from Bordeaux, including their prices and mentioning Chateau Petrus as an exception due to its smaller production size. This detailed information expands on the initial claim, giving more concrete details about the high-priced bottles mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||These prices seem rather modest , however , in light of other French wines from current vintages .||Chateau Yquem , the leading Sauternes , now goes for well over $ 100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984||The first sentence states that the prices of certain French wines appear modest in comparison to others from recent vintages. The second sentence provides specific information about the price of Chateau Yquem, a leading Sauternes, which costs over $100 a bottle even for a lighter vintage. The second sentence expands on the first by giving an example of a high-priced wine that justifies why the original prices mentioned seem modest. The detail about Chateau Yquem's price adds depth to the claim that some wines are significantly more expensive, thereby expanding the context of the comparison.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Chateau Yquem , the leading Sauternes , now goes for well over $ 100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984||the spectacularly rich 1983 runs $ 179||The first sentence states that Chateau Yquem, a renowned Sauternes, costs more than $100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984. The second sentence provides more specific information about the pricing by mentioning the cost of a particularly rich vintage, 1983, at $179. This additional detail expands on the initial statement about pricing, illustrating the relationship as one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The first Champagne to crack that price barrier was the 1979 Salon de Mesnil Blanc de Blancs .||The '82 Salon is $ 115 .||The first sentence introduces the 1979 Salon de Mesnil Blanc de Blancs as the first Champagne to break a certain price barrier. The second sentence provides additional information about another vintage from the same brand, specifically the price of the 1982 Salon. The expansion relationship is established because the second sentence broadens the context by including more detail about a related product from the same line, enhancing our understanding of the pricing and prestige associated with the Salon de Mesnil brand.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The '82 Salon is $ 115 .||Roederer Cristal at $ 90 a bottle sells out around the country||The first sentence provides the price of the '82 Salon, which is $115.The second sentence gives additional information about another product, Roederer Cristal, specifying its price at $90 a bottle and noting that it sells out around the country.

Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||None of France 's wine regions can steal a march on Burgundy , however .||The six wines of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti , 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world , have commanded three-digit price tags for several years now .||The first sentence asserts that no other French wine region can outpace Burgundy, suggesting Burgundy's dominance in the context of French wine regions. The second sentence provides specific details about Burgundy's dominance by mentioning the prestigious Domaine de la Romanee-Conti and its high-priced wines. This detail supports the claim made in the first sentence, expanding on the idea of Burgundy's superiority in the wine world. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by offering concrete examples of Burgundy's exceptional status.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||The six wines of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti , 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world , have commanded three-digit price tags for several years now .||With the 1985 vintage , they soared higher : La Tache , $ 195 ; Richebourg , $ 180 ; Romanee-Conti , $ 225 .||The first sentence states that the wines from the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti have commanded three-digit price tags for several years. The second sentence provides specific examples of these prices with the 1985 vintage, detailing the cost of La Tache, Richebourg, and Romanee-Conti. This detailed information expands on the initial statement about the high prices of the wines, offering concrete evidence of those prices. Therefore, the relationship between these two sentences is one of expansion, where the latter provides more specific details about the topic introduced in the former.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||With the 1985 vintage , they soared higher : La Tache , $ 195 ; Richebourg , $ 180 ; Romanee-Conti , $ 225 .||Another small Burgundy estate , Coche-Dury , has just offered its 1987 Corton-Charlemagne for $ 155 .||The first sentence provides prices for specific wines from a certain year (1985 vintage) at certain estates (La Tache, Richebourg, Romanee-Conti).The second sentence introduces another estate (Coche-Dury) and gives the price of one of its wines (1987 Corton-Charlemagne) from a different year. This new information expands on the topic of high-priced wines from prestigious Burgundy estates by including another estate and another vintage. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.

The second sentence introduces wines from Spain and Australia, also noting their prices. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence broadens the scope of the information from Italian wines to include wines from other countries (Spain and Australia).

['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||We 've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the '40s and '50s , which go for $ 300 to $ 400 a bottle||Some of the newer wines , even at $ 90 to $ 100 a bottle or so , almost offer a bargain . ''||The first sentence discusses the decrease in demand for wines from the '40s and '50s, which are priced at $300 to $400 a bottle. The second sentence introduces newer wines that cost significantly less ($90 to $100 a bottle) and suggests they offer a bargain. The comparison is evident as the second sentence contrasts the prices of newer wines with those mentioned in the first sentence, implying that the newer wines are relatively affordable.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||but when a retailer in Southern California asked , `` Is that wholesale or retail ? '' he re-thought the matter .||Offering the wine at roughly $ 65 a bottle wholesale $ 100 retail , he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers : 1 no , the wine is too high 2 responses ; 2 yes , it 's high but I 'll take it 2 responses ; 3 I 'll take all I can get 58 responses .||The first sentence indicates that the individual reconsidered something after a retailer questioned whether the price mentioned was wholesale or retail. The second sentence details the action taken following this reconsideration: offering the wine at specific prices and sending out a form to merchants to gauge their interest. The sequence of events—rethinking, then taking action—establishes a temporal relationship between the two sentences.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||Offering the wine at roughly $ 65 a bottle wholesale $ 100 retail , he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers : 1 no , the wine is too high 2 responses ; 2 yes , it 's high but I 'll take it 2 responses ; 3 I 'll take all I can get 58 responses .||The wine was shipped in six-bottle cases instead of the usual 12 , but even at that it was spread thin , going to 62 retailers in 28 states .||The first sentence describes the process of offering the wine for sale, including the options provided to merchants.The second sentence indicates what happened after the offer: the wine was shipped in smaller quantities than usual due to limited availability, and it was distributed across many retailers in multiple states. The sequence of events—offering the wine, then shipping it—establishes a temporal relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||but there are people out there with very different opinions of value .||and they 're gone . ''||The first sentence indicates that there are individuals with diverse views on value. The second sentence, "and they're gone," suggests a consequence or action related to those differing opinions. However, without more context, the exact nature of the contingency is unclear. It can be inferred that something happened to these individuals with differing opinions, possibly that they left or were dismissed in some sense, as a result of their differing views. The relationship is contingent because the second sentence appears to describe an outcome or action that follows from the situation described in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||steeper prices have come about because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on||Even if there is consumer resistance at first , a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move .||The first sentence explains the reason for steeper prices: producers dislike seeing a popular wine increase in price later. The second sentence describes what happens when a wine receives high ratings: it will eventually sell, despite initial consumer resistance. The contingency relationship is evident here because the action taken by producers (setting higher initial prices) is contingent upon their preference (avoiding price hikes on hit wines later). The eventual sale of highly-rated wines justifies the producer's preemptive pricing strategy, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Even if there is consumer resistance at first , a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move .||There may be sticker-shock reaction initially but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell , they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection . ''||The first sentence states that despite initial consumer resistance, a wine with high critic ratings will eventually sell.The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining the process through which consumers' resistance turns into acceptance and excitement. It elaborates on the reasons for initial resistance (sticker shock) and how this changes over time as the wine gains attention and sales. The expansion is evident in the detailed description of the consumer behavior change that leads to the eventual success of the wine.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||It 's just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people||`` They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace one of Diamond Creek 's Cabernets or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet , or the Petrus .||The first sentence indicates that there is a competitive aspect ("one-upsmanship") among certain individuals when it comes to talking about what they have. The second sentence provides specific examples of what these people like to talk about: the new Red Rock Terrace from Diamond Creek, the Dunn 1985 Cabernet, or the Petrus. These examples expand upon the concept introduced in the first sentence by illustrating the type of items (specific wines) that these individuals use to compete or show off. Thus, the second sentence expands the context of the first sentence by providing more detail about the subject matter of the "one-upsmanship."
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||`` They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace one of Diamond Creek 's Cabernets or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet , or the Petrus .||and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people . ''||The first sentence indicates the preferences of a certain group of people who enjoy talking about specific wines.The second sentence states that wines are being created to appeal to these people. The creation of wines that appeal to the mentioned group is contingent upon knowing their preferences, as described in the first sentence. In other words, the second sentence describes an action taken in response to the preferences outlined in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago .||They wo n't buy if the quality is not there||The first sentence indicates that current consumers at this level are more knowledgeable than they were in the past. The second sentence states that these consumers will not make a purchase if the quality is lacking. The contingency relationship is demonstrated by the fact that the consumers' purchasing decision (not buying if quality is not there) is contingent upon their increased knowledge. Their behavior (buying or not buying) is influenced by their level of knowledge, which has grown over the years.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Image has , of course , a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't , and it ca n't be forced .||Wine merchants ca n't keep Roederer Cristal in stock , but they have to push Salon le Mesnil , even lowering the price from $ 115 to $ 90 .||The first sentence makes a general statement about the role of image in sales and notes that it can't be forced. The second sentence provides a specific example of this concept through the contrasting situations of two types of wine: Roederer Cristal, which sells well without needing promotion, and Salon le Mesnil, which requires active pushing and price reduction to sell. This example illustrates the idea that certain products sell based on their image without needing additional marketing efforts, while others struggle despite attempts to boost their sales. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the idea presented in the first one by providing a concrete instance of how image affects sales.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'although'] ||but they have to push Salon le Mesnil , even lowering the price from $ 115 to $ 90 .||It 's hardly a question of quality||The first sentence indicates that there has been a price reduction for Salon le Mesnil, suggesting some difficulty in promoting or selling it.The second sentence asserts that the issue is not related to the quality of the product. By comparing the need to lower the price with the assertion that quality is not the problem, the relationship highlights that the reason for the price drop is something other than quality, possibly suggesting issues like market demand or competition. This comparison helps to clarify the reason behind the price reduction.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||With the biggest wine-buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach , it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare .||By January it should be fairly clear what 's hot -- and what 's not .||The first sentence indicates that the major wine-buying season is approaching and expresses interest in observing the performance of superpremium wines during this period. The second sentence provides more specific timing for when we can expect to see the results of this observation, specifying that by January, it will be clear which wines are popular and which are not. This additional detail expands upon the initial statement by specifying when the outcome of the mentioned situation will become evident, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||A survey by the Fed 's 12 district banks shows economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks , while upward pressures on prices have moderated .||The economy is clearly slowing||The first sentence indicates that according to a survey by the Federal Reserve's 12 district banks, economic growth has been slow and price pressures have lessened. The second sentence directly states that the economy is clearly slowing down. The second sentence expands on the information provided in the first by confirming and clarifying the slowdown in the economy, thus providing additional support and elaboration.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||the slowdown so far is no cause for concern||We 're coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur||The first sentence indicates that the current economic slowdown isn't concerning. The second sentence outlines the objective of slowing the economy to achieve a downward trend in prices. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the context that the lack of concern over the slowdown (first sentence) is because it aligns with the intended goal of reducing prices (second sentence). The attitude towards the slowdown being non-alarming is contingent upon its alignment with the desired economic outcome.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||As a result , Fed officials may be divided over whether to ease credit .||Several Fed governors in Washington have been pushing for easier credit ; but many of the regional Fed presidents have been resisting such a move .||The first sentence states that Federal Reserve (Fed) officials may be divided over whether to ease credit. The second sentence expands on this division by providing specific details about who is on each side of the debate: some Fed governors in Washington support easier credit, while many regional Fed presidents oppose it. The second sentence offers additional information that clarifies and elaborates on the initial statement about differing opinions within the Fed, hence forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Under the offer , shareholders will receive one right for each 105 common shares owned .||Each right entitles the shareholder to buy $ 100 face amount of 13.5 % bonds due 1993 and warrants to buy 23.5 common shares at 30 cents a share .||The first sentence introduces an offer where shareholders receive rights based on the number of common shares they own. The second sentence explains what those rights entail: the ability to purchase a specific amount of bonds and warrants to buy common shares at a fixed price. The second sentence expands on the details of the rights mentioned in the first sentence, providing more information about what the shareholders can do with these rights. Thus, the relationship is one of expansion, where additional information is provided to clarify the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Each right entitles the shareholder to buy $ 100 face amount of 13.5 % bonds due 1993 and warrants to buy 23.5 common shares at 30 cents a share .||The rights , which expire Nov. 21 , can be exercised for $ 100 each .||The first sentence introduces the concept of rights for shareholders, detailing what each right allows: purchasing $100 face amount of 13.5% bonds due in 1993 and warrants to buy 23.5 common shares at 30 cents per share. The second sentence further clarifies the nature of these rights by specifying their expiration date (Nov. 21) and the cost to exercise each right ($100). This additional information expands upon the initial description of the rights, explaining more about how they function and their terms. Thus, the second sentence provides an expansion of the details related to the rights described in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||Copperweld said it does n't expect a protracted strike .||It said it has taken measures to continue shipments during the work stoppage .||In the first sentence, Copperweld indicates that they do not anticipate a long strike. In the second sentence, Copperweld explains how they plan to manage during the strike by mentioning measures taken to ensure ongoing shipments. This sentence expands on the idea presented in the first sentence by providing more detail about Copperweld's preparedness and strategy during the anticipated short strike, thus further explaining their expectation of its non-prolonged nature.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||whether the autions are to be rescheduled||Unless it can raise money in financial markets the federal government wo n't have the cash to pay off $ 13.8 billion in Treasury bills that mature on Thursday .||The first sentence introduces a condition or uncertainty about whether auctions are to be rescheduled. The second sentence presents a consequence or scenario that depends on the condition mentioned in the first sentence: if the federal government cannot raise money in financial markets, it will not have the cash to pay off maturing Treasury bills. Thus, the need for the federal government to raise money (or the contingency plan) is contingent upon the uncertainty of the auctions being rescheduled, implying that the outcome of the auctions (or lack thereof) could impact the government's financial situation.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Investors took advantage of Tuesday 's stock rally to book some profits yesterday , leaving stocks up fractionally .||Bond prices and the dollar both gained modestly .||The first sentence states that investors took profits during a stock rally, resulting in a fractional increase in stock prices. The second sentence provides additional information about the market's movements, specifically that bond prices and the dollar both gained modestly. These two sentences together provide a broader picture of the day's financial activity. The relationship is one of expansion, as the second sentence adds more detail about the overall market performance, complementing the information about stocks in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||But advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange were tidily ahead of declining stocks , 847 to 644 .||Long-term bond prices rose despite prospects of a huge new supply of Treasury debt this month .||The first sentence indicates that on the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones, with specific numbers provided (847 to 644). The second sentence discusses long-term bond prices rising, even though there is an expectation of a significant increase in Treasury debt supply.While the sentences cover different aspects of the financial market (stocks vs. bonds), the expansion relationship is evident through the context of the overall market conditions. The positive movement in stock prices (advancing issues leading) can be seen as part of a broader favorable market environment, which also includes the rise in long-term bond prices. Thus, the information in the second sentence expands upon the general positive market tone set by the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Long-term bond prices rose despite prospects of a huge new supply of Treasury debt this month .||Continuing demand for dollars from Japanese investors boosted the U.S. currency .||The first sentence states that long-term bond prices rose despite the expectation of a large issuance of new Treasury debt. The second sentence indicates that there is ongoing demand for dollars from Japanese investors, which supports the value of the U.S. currency. The relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion because the second sentence provides additional context that could contribute to the rise in bond prices mentioned in the first sentence. Specifically, if Japanese investors are demanding dollars, they may also be investing in U.S. bonds, thus helping to increase bond prices.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Economic news had little effect on financial markets .||As expected , a national purchasing managers ' report indicated the nation 's manufacturing sector continues to contract modestly .||The first sentence states that economic news had little effect on financial markets. The second sentence provides specific details of economic news that supports the claim of having little effect on the markets: a national purchasing managers' report indicated the nation's manufacturing sector continues to contract modestly as expected. This detail expands on what kind of economic news did not impact the markets, thus the relationship is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||As expected , a national purchasing managers ' report indicated the nation 's manufacturing sector continues to contract modestly .||The Federal Reserve 's Beige Book , a summary of economic conditions across the country , indicated that the overall economy remains in a pattern of sluggish growth .||The first sentence discusses a specific piece of evidence (the national purchasing managers' report) indicating that the manufacturing sector is contracting modestly. The second sentence expands on the context by providing additional information from another source (the Federal Reserve's Beige Book) which shows that the broader economy is also experiencing slow growth. This expansion of context helps to reinforce the initial observation about the manufacturing sector by showing that the issue is part of a larger trend affecting the whole economy.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Stock prices rose fractionally in moderate trading .||Big Board volume totaled 154.2 million shares .||The first sentence states that stock prices rose fractionally in moderate trading. The second sentence provides more specific information about the trading activity by mentioning the total volume of shares traded on the Big Board. This additional detail expands on the description of the trading conditions mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds more context and detail to the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Stock prices rose fractionally in moderate trading . Big Board volume totaled 154.2 million shares .||Bond prices were up .||The first sentence reports that stock prices rose fractionally in moderate trading and provides specific information about the volume of shares traded on the Big Board. The second sentence simply states that bond prices were up. The expansion relationship is demonstrated by the fact that the second sentence adds additional information (the rise in bond prices) that is relevant to the context established in the first sentence (market activity). Both sentences discuss movements in financial markets, with the second sentence expanding on the market conditions described in the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Bond prices were up .||The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond gained about a quarter of a point , or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 of face amount .||The first sentence states that bond prices increased. The second sentence provides specific details about how much one particular bond, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, gained in value. It quantifies the increase mentioned in the first sentence, thereby expanding on the initial statement with more precise information. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence adds detail and specificity to the general statement made in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond gained about a quarter of a point , or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 of face amount .||The yield fell to 7.88 % .||The first sentence states that the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained about a quarter of a point, indicating an increase in the bond's value. The second sentence provides additional information about the change in the bond's yield, which fell to 7.88%. In the bond market, when the price of a bond rises, its yield typically falls, and vice versa. Therefore, the decrease in yield reported in the second sentence is an expansion or elaboration on the gain in the bond's price mentioned in the first sentence. It explains the effect of the price change on the yield.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||The dollar rose .||In late afternoon New York trading the currency was at 1.8500 marks and 143.80 yen compared with 1.8415 marks and 142.85 yen .||The first sentence states that the dollar rose in value. The second sentence provides specific details about how the dollar's value changed in terms of marks and yen during late afternoon New York trading. This detail shows the exact exchange rates before and after the rise, demonstrating the increase in the dollar's value. Thus, the second sentence expands upon the first by giving concrete evidence of the dollar's rise.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Pacific Sierra , based in Los Angeles , has about 200 employees and supplies professional services and advanced products to industry .||Eaton is an automotive parts , controls and aerospace electronics concern .||The first sentence introduces Pacific Sierra, describing its location, number of employees, and business focus.The second sentence provides additional context by specifying another company, Eaton, and detailing its areas of operation (automotive parts, controls, and aerospace electronics). While the two sentences do not directly relate to each other in terms of cause and effect or sequence of events, the second sentence expands the context by introducing a related entity (Eaton) within the same industry sector, thus providing more information about the professional services and advanced products sector mentioned in the first sentence. This establishes an expansion relationship where additional information is provided to enrich the context of the initial statement.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||The offer follows an earlier proposal by NL and Mr. Simmons to help Georgia Gulf restructure or go private in a transaction that would pay shareholders $ 55 a share .||Georgia Gulf rebuffed that offer in September .||The first sentence introduces an offer made by NL and Mr. Simmons to assist Georgia Gulf, with terms that included paying shareholders $55 a share. The second sentence indicates that Georgia Gulf rejected a previous offer in September. Since both offers involve NL and Mr. Simmons proposing actions to Georgia Gulf, the relationship between the two sentences can be seen as comparative. They compare the current offer to the earlier one that was rejected, highlighting the continuity of interaction between the parties involved.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||it reviewed the NL proposal as well as interests from `` third parties '' regarding business combinations||it has n't eliminated any alternatives and that `` discussions are being held with interested parties , and work is also continuing on other various transactions||The first sentence states that the entity reviewed the NL proposal along with interests from third parties for business combinations. The second sentence expands on this by specifying that discussions are ongoing with interested parties and work continues on various other transactions. This shows further detail about the nature of the interactions with third parties and the range of transactions being considered, providing more context and elaboration on the initial statement.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||it has n't eliminated any alternatives and that `` discussions are being held with interested parties , and work is also continuing on other various transactions||It did n't elaborate .||The first sentence states that no alternatives have been eliminated and that discussions are ongoing with interested parties while work continues on other transactions. The second sentence says there was no elaboration provided. These sentences are not directly comparable, nor does one entail or temporally follow the other. The comparison here could refer to the level of detail provided: the first sentence gives some information about the situation, while the second notes the lack of further detail or elaboration. However, the relationship does not clearly fit into the provided categories of Entailment, Temporal, or Contingency. Given the options and the need for an explanation within the defined framework, this example may not perfectly align with the Comparison relationship but rather suggests a contrast in the amount of information disclosed.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||that Mr. Simmons , an aggressive and persistent investor , wo n't leave Georgia Gulf alone until some kind of transaction is completed||He has clamped on their ankle like a pit bull||The first sentence states that Mr. Simmons, described as an aggressive and persistent investor, will continue to pursue Georgia Gulf until a transaction is completed. The second sentence expands on this idea by using a metaphor ("clamped on their ankle like a pit bull") to emphasize Mr. Simmons' tenacity and determination. The second sentence does not introduce new information but rather elaborates on Mr. Simmons' persistence as mentioned in the first sentence, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||He has clamped on their ankle like a pit bull||`` He appears to be in it for the long haul . ''||The first sentence uses the metaphor of a pit bull clamping down on an ankle to describe someone's tenacious behavior. The second sentence expands on this idea by suggesting that the person is committed to a long-term effort ("in it for the long haul"). The second sentence provides additional information that explains or extends the meaning of the first sentence, illustrating the person's determination and persistence. This connection shows that the second sentence is expanding on the idea introduced in the first one.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||It was n't clear how NL and Mr. Simmons would respond if Georgia Gulf spurns them again .||they have n't yet decided what their next move would be||The first sentence states that it was unclear how NL and Mr. Simmons would react if Georgia Gulf rejects them again. This implies uncertainty about their potential response. The second sentence directly addresses this uncertainty by specifying that NL and Mr. Simmons have not yet decided on their next move. The second sentence expands on the uncertainty expressed in the first sentence by providing more detail about the indecision of NL and Mr. Simmons.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed at replacing Georgia Gulf 's board||In other transactions , Mr. Simmons has followed friendly offers with a hostile tender offer .||The first sentence introduces the idea of a consent solicitation to replace Georgia Gulf's board. The second sentence provides context about Mr. Simmons' past behavior in similar situations, where he has escalated from friendly offers to hostile tender offers. This suggests that the consent solicitation could be part of a broader pattern of actions taken by Mr. Simmons, expanding on the initial idea introduced in the first sentence. The second sentence adds detail and background information that helps to expand the understanding of the situation described in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||the company 's management is interested in some kind of transaction||The management group owns about 18 % of the stock , most purchased at nominal prices , and would stand to gain millions of dollars if the company were sold .||The first sentence indicates the company's management has an interest in a transaction.The second sentence provides context for why they might be interested in such a transaction: the management group owns a significant portion of the stock and could profit greatly from a sale. Therefore, the management's potential financial gain is contingent upon their interest in pursuing a transaction, creating a contingent relationship between the two sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||In the third quarter , Georgia Gulf earned $ 46.1 million , or $ 1.85 a share , down from $ 53 million , or $ 1.85 a share on fewer shares outstanding .||Sales fell to $ 251.2 million from $ 278.7 million .||The first sentence states that Georgia Gulf's earnings decreased in the third quarter compared to the previous period, specifying the amounts and noting that the per-share earnings remained the same due to fewer shares outstanding.The second sentence provides additional information about the company's financial performance by stating that sales also fell during the same period. This additional detail further explains the context of the earnings decline, expanding on the financial picture of the company for the quarter.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||In May , University Patents filed a suit in federal court in Philadelphia against Albert M. Kligman , a researcher and professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine who developed Retin-A in the 1960s to combat acne .||Dr. Kligman patented the medicine while employed by the University , but later licensed the Retin-A to a division of Johnson & Johnson .||The first sentence states that University Patents filed a lawsuit against Dr. Kligman, who had developed Retin-A.The second sentence explains that Dr. Kligman patented the medicine while working for the University but later licensed it to Johnson & Johnson. This provides context for the lawsuit: the contingency lies in the fact that the lawsuit was filed due to the circumstances surrounding Dr. Kligman's patent and licensing of Retin-A. The relationship is contingent because the filing of the lawsuit is directly related to the actions taken by Dr. Kligman regarding the patent and license of Retin-A.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'but'] ||the U.S. public 's skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in Washington||Not that Washington and Tokyo disagree on the Japanese acquisitions||The first sentence discusses the potential impact of the U.S. public's concerns about Japanese investment on upcoming economic talks. The second sentence states that there isn't disagreement between Washington and Tokyo over the acquisitions. The comparison lies in contrasting the public's sentiment with the official stance of the governments, suggesting that while the public may be uneasy, the governments themselves do not have issues with the acquisitions. This establishes a comparison between public opinion and governmental perspective on the matter.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Where they disagree is on the subject of U.S. direct investment in Japan .||The U.S. wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment ; Japan denies there are real barriers .||The first sentence states that the point of disagreement between the U.S. and Japan is U.S. direct investment in Japan. The second sentence expands on this disagreement by specifying the nature of the dispute: the U.S. seeks the removal of perceived investment barriers, while Japan denies that such barriers exist. The second sentence provides additional detail about the nature of the disagreement mentioned in the first sentence, hence forming an expansion relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The U.S. wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment||Japan denies there are real barriers||The first sentence states the perspective of the U.S. regarding perceived barriers to investment in Japan. The second sentence presents Japan's viewpoint, denying the existence of real barriers. The comparison relationship is established through contrasting perspectives on the same issue: while the U.S. sees barriers, Japan disputes this view, highlighting a difference in opinion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||We have a long history of maintaining an open direct-investment policy||`` U.S. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment '' in Japan .||The first sentence indicates a commitment to an open direct-investment policy.The second sentence suggests that U.S. investors should have more opportunities for direct investment in Japan. The speaker's stance on direct investment in the first sentence can imply a reason for advocating for greater investment opportunities in the second sentence. In other words, the speaker's favorable view of direct investment (as stated in the first sentence) supports or leads to the suggestion that U.S. investors should have more opportunities in Japan (second sentence). Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the speaker's policy stance influences their advocacy for specific actions.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The Japanese fret openly about the U.S. public 's rancor .||One clear sign of Japan 's nervousness came this week , when a spokesman for Japan 's Foreign Ministry devoted nearly all of a regular , half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent Japanese investments in the U.S. .||The first sentence states that the Japanese are visibly worried about the resentment from the American public. The second sentence provides a specific example of how Japan demonstrated this nervousness: a Foreign Ministry spokesperson focused almost entirely on the topic of recent Japanese investments in the U.S. during a briefing. This detailed example expands upon the initial statement of the Japanese being visibly worried, thereby creating an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||But he has failed to gain any influence at the company .||Koito has refused to grant Mr. Pickens seats on its board , .||The first sentence states that the person (presumably Mr. Pickens) has failed to gain any influence at the company. The second sentence provides a specific instance of this failure: Koito has refused to grant Mr. Pickens seats on its board. This refusal is an example of how Mr. Pickens has been unable to gain influence, thus expanding on the initial statement about his lack of influence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Mr. Pickens made considerable political hay with his troubles in Japan .||The Senate Finance Committee , chaired by a fellow Texan , Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen , last month urged U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills to use Mr. Pickens 's experience in talks with Tokyo `` to highlight this problem facing Americans who seek access to the Japanese capital markets . ''||The first sentence states that Mr. Pickens generated significant attention and leverage from his issues in Japan. The second sentence expands on this by detailing how the Senate Finance Committee, led by a fellow Texan, Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, used Mr. Pickens's experience to support the argument for fairer trade negotiations with Japan. This shows that the political hay mentioned in the first sentence included the committee's urging of the U.S. Trade Representative to leverage Mr. Pickens's experience. Thus, the second sentence provides additional details about the specific political actions taken as a result of Mr. Pickens's situation, expanding on the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||Among them are differences in savings and investment rates , corporate structures and management , and government spending .||Each side has a litany of recommendations for the other .||The first sentence lists several areas where differences exist, including savings and investment rates, corporate structures and management, and government spending. The second sentence introduces a related idea: each side has a list of recommendations for the other. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence builds upon the idea introduced in the first sentence by specifying that these differences lead to each side having suggestions for improvement. In other words, the differences mentioned in the first sentence are expanded upon in the second sentence, explaining one of the consequences or outcomes of these differences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||it is anxious for results||We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we 've identified , and we need it by next spring||The first sentence conveys a sense of urgency and desire for outcomes, indicating anxiety for results. The second sentence expands on this sentiment by specifying what "anxious for results" means in more detail: the speaker feels strongly about the need for action on specific issues by a certain deadline (next spring). Therefore, the second sentence provides additional information that elaborates on the meaning of being "anxious for results," making the relationship between the two sentences one of expansion.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||After the first set of meetings two months ago , some U.S. officials complained that Japan had n't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make .||The Japanese retort that the first round was too early to make concessions .||The first sentence indicates that following the initial meetings, U.S. officials were unhappy because Japan had not proposed any concrete changes. The second sentence presents the Japanese perspective, suggesting that it was too soon during the first round for them to make concessions. Here, the comparison is drawn between the expectations and reactions of the U.S. officials versus the rationale of the Japanese representatives, highlighting differing viewpoints on the timing and appropriateness of making concessions in the negotiation process.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Alternative', 'instead'] ||Just to say the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything||`` We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it . ''||The first sentence states that simply claiming the distribution system is wrong lacks meaningful detail.The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying what should be done to address the issue: clarifying exactly what is wrong with the system. The expansion is evident because the second sentence provides a specific course of action (clarification) that builds upon the initial criticism expressed in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Since then , a team of about 15 MITI and U.S. Commerce Department officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices .||By Monday , they hope to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust .||The first sentence states that a team of MITI and U.S. Commerce Department officials have been working to gauge consumer prices globally since a certain point in time. The second sentence explains what the team hopes to achieve by a specific deadline (Monday): obtaining a set of trusted documents. The second sentence expands on the activities and goals of the team mentioned in the first sentence, providing additional detail about their work and objectives. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence provides more information about the ongoing activities of the team described in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Little by little , there is progress||`` Both sides are taking action . ''||The first sentence indicates that progress is being made gradually. The second sentence states that both sides are taking action. The contingency relationship is evident because the actions taken by both sides (second sentence) are likely contributing factors to the gradual progress mentioned in the first sentence. In other words, the actions of both sides are contingent upon or lead to the observed progress.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||Take the deal with Candela Laser Corp. , a Wayland , Mass. , manufacturer of high-tech medical devices , which three years ago set its sights on Japan as an export market .||, tiny Candela turned to Mitsui & Co. , one of Japan 's largest trading companies , for investment .||The first sentence outlines Candela Laser Corp.'s decision to target Japan as an export market three years ago. The second sentence then details a specific action taken by Candela: they sought investment from Mitsui & Co., a large Japanese trading company. The contingency relationship is evident because the action of seeking investment from Mitsui & Co. is directly linked to and contingent upon Candela's decision to enter the Japanese market. In other words, the choice to target Japan as an export market led to the subsequent step of engaging with Mitsui & Co. for investment.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||In a joint-venture deal , Mitsui guided Candela through Tokyo 's bureaucratic maze .||It eventually secured Ministry of Health import approval for two Candela laser products -- .||The first sentence states that Mitsui helped Candela navigate the bureaucratic processes in Tokyo as part of a joint venture deal. The second sentence mentions that they eventually gained approval from the Ministry of Health for two of Candela's products. The temporal relationship is evident here: Mitsui's assistance (the first event) led to the eventual approval (the second event), indicating a sequence of events over time. The approval came after the guidance through the bureaucratic process, establishing the temporal connection.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The Japanese companies bankroll many small U.S. companies with promising products or ideas , frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks wo n't touch .||Japanese companies have financed small and medium-sized U.S. firms for years||The first sentence explains how Japanese companies provide financial support to small U.S. companies with potential, often funding ventures commercial banks avoid. The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying that this financing activity has been ongoing for years. The second sentence broadens the context of the first by indicating the long-term nature of this financial relationship, providing additional information that enhances our understanding of the duration of this practice.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Heightened Japanese interest in American small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control of large , highly visible U.S. corporations , such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc .||that Mitsubishi Estate Co. had acquired a 51 % stake in Rockefeller Group , which owns New York 's prestigious Rockefeller Center||The first sentence outlines a scenario where there is increased interest from Japan in American small businesses, alongside growing investments that grant Japanese firms control over significant U.S. corporations, such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. The second sentence provides a specific instance of this trend with Mitsubishi Estate Co. acquiring a majority stake in Rockefeller Group, the owner of New York's Rockefeller Center. This instance expands upon the broader trend described in the first sentence, illustrating how Japanese companies are gaining control over high-profile American entities. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence offers a particular example of the phenomenon mentioned in the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Even a low-tech product like plate glass can catch a trading company 's fancy if there 's a strategic fit .||Free State Glass Industries of Warrenton , Va. , a small fabricator of architectural glass , was foundering under its original management .||The first sentence introduces the idea that even a low-tech product, such as plate glass, can become attractive to a trading company if there is a strategic fit. The second sentence then provides an example of a specific company, Free State Glass Industries, which deals with architectural glass and faced challenges under its original management. This second sentence expands on the initial concept by offering a real-world illustration of a glass-related business experiencing difficulties, potentially explaining why such a company might need to find a strategic fit with another entity.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||Free State Glass Industries of Warrenton , Va. , a small fabricator of architectural glass , was foundering under its original management .||Last year , Mitsubishi International Corp. , the New York-based arm of Mitsubishi Corp. , bought controlling interest in the glass company in a joint venture with Ronald Bodner , a glass industry executive and Mitsubishi consultant .||The first sentence states that Free State Glass Industries was struggling under its original management. The second sentence describes an event that occurred last year: Mitsubishi International Corp., along with Ronald Bodner, acquired a controlling interest in the glass company. The temporal relationship is established by the sequence of events: the company's struggles under original management happened before the acquisition by Mitsubishi and Bodner. This sequence indicates a temporal connection between the two sentences.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||The deal is chiefly designed to give Mitsubishi a window on the U.S. glass industry ,||It 's not just a simple investment in a small company||The first sentence states the primary purpose of the deal, which is to provide Mitsubishi with insights into the U.S. glass industry.The second sentence clarifies that the deal has broader implications beyond being a simple investment in a small company. This suggests that the deal serves multiple purposes, one of which is highlighted in the first sentence. Therefore, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, providing additional context or clarification about the nature of the deal.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'rather'] ||It 's not just a simple investment in a small company||`` We want to see the glass market from the inside , not the outside . ''||The first sentence indicates that the investment in the small company is not simple, suggesting there's more depth to the situation.The second sentence provides additional context for the investment: they want to gain insider knowledge and perspective on the glass market. This clarifies the motivation behind the investment, expanding on the initial statement by explaining why the investment is not simple. The relationship between the sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds detail to the first.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Mitsubishi 's investment in Free State is `` very small ... less than $ 4 million , '' Mr. Wakui says .||Mr. Bodner declines to comment on the arrangement .||In the first sentence, Mr. Wakui provides information about the scale of Mitsubishi's investment in Free State, describing it as "very small" and specifying that it is less than $4 million. In the second sentence, Mr. Bodner's response is noted as declining to comment on the same arrangement. The comparison relationship is evident through the contrast in how the two individuals handle providing details about the investment: Mr. Wakui gives specific information while Mr. Bodner chooses not to comment at all. This contrast in their responses creates a point of comparison regarding their approaches to discussing the investment.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||These vertically integrated combines , , deal globally in commodities , construction and manufacturing .||They operate ships and banks .||The first sentence states that certain vertically integrated companies deal globally in various sectors like commodities, construction, and manufacturing. The second sentence provides additional activities these companies engage in, specifically operating ships and banks. This additional information expands upon the initial description of what these companies do, illustrating the breadth of their operations beyond the sectors mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the second sentence expands on the information provided in the first one by detailing specific operational aspects (operating ships and banks) of these global companies.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Alternative', 'rather'] ||Profit , at least in the short term , is usually a secondary goal .||Strategic objectives , not financial return , drive many of the deals||The first sentence states that profit, especially in the short term, is often a secondary goal for companies. The second sentence elaborates on this idea by explaining what typically drives these goals: strategic objectives rather than financial returns. Thus, the second sentence expands on the concept introduced in the first one, providing more detail about the nature of these non-profit-driven goals.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||It 's the classic problem of the small businessman||`` People are queuing at the door to take his product but he does n't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very unsympathetic .||The first sentence introduces the concept of a classic problem faced by a small businessman. The second sentence expands on this problem by providing specific details about the situation: customers are eager to buy his product, yet he lacks the necessary working capital to produce it and is facing unsympathetic commercial banks. The additional information serves to elaborate on what the "classic problem" entails, hence forming an expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||and commercial banks are very unsympathetic||They want assets , they want a balance sheet , which has no relation to the business a company can generate . ''||The first sentence states that commercial banks are very unsympathetic. The second sentence explains what this unsympathetic attitude means in practice: they focus on assets and balance sheets rather than a company's potential for generating business. The second sentence provides a reason or elaboration for the unsympathetic nature of commercial banks, suggesting that their priorities (assets and balance sheets) do not align with a company's operational capabilities. This relationship indicates that the second sentence is contingent upon the first, as it explains the context or consequences of the banks' unsympathetic stance.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||Unlike corporations in this country , trading companies are n't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows||To the extent they can do this , they 're quite content to get a return on investment of 1 % to 2 % . ''||The first sentence states that trading companies prioritize increasing trade flows over a high return on investment compared to corporations. The second sentence explains that they are satisfied with a low return on investment (1% to 2%) as long as they can increase trade flows. The willingness to accept a lower return on investment is contingent upon the goal of increasing trade flows, as stated in the first sentence. The second sentence provides the condition under which trading companies are content with minimal returns, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||I deserve something for my loyalty||She took her business to First Atlanta .||The first sentence expresses a feeling of entitlement based on loyalty. The second sentence details an action taken by the speaker, which is moving her business to First Atlanta. This suggests that the speaker believes they are entitled to better treatment or reward for their loyalty, and as a result, they have decided to change their service provider. The action taken (switching to First Atlanta) is contingent upon the feeling of deserving better, indicating a contingent relationship.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'previously'] ||So it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days .||For nearly a decade , banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans .||The first sentence reflects on the current competitive state of consumer banking. The second sentence provides context about how banks have competed for customers over the past decade. The temporal relationship here is that the historical context provided in the second sentence sets the stage for understanding the present situation described in the first sentence. In other words, the way banks have competed in the past (over nearly a decade) has led to the current competitive environment, establishing a temporal connection.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Synchrony', 'meanwhile'] ||For nearly a decade , banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans .||The competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services .||The first sentence indicates that banks have been competing for customers using interest rates for nearly a decade.The second sentence describes another aspect of this competition: the use of fees to offset competitive rates. Although the relationship between the two sentences is not strictly temporal, the context implies a sequence of practices over time: first, the competition through interest rates, then the implementation of fees to counterbalance those rates. Thus, the temporal relationship is inferred from the sequence of banking practices described.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||NCNB Corp. of Charlotte , N.C. , recently introduced its Financial Connections Program aimed at young adults just starting careers .||The program not only offers a pre-approved car loan up to $ 18,000 , but throws in a special cash-flow statement to help in saving money .||The first sentence introduces the Financial Connections Program targeted at young adults starting their careers. The second sentence provides more details about what the program offers: a pre-approved car loan and a special cash-flow statement for budgeting. Thus, the second sentence expands on the information from the first by giving specific examples of benefits offered by the program, deepening our understanding of its contents.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||For some time , banks have been aiming packages at the elderly , the demographic segment with the highest savings .||Those efforts are being stepped up .||The first sentence indicates that banks have been targeting the elderly with specific offers for a period of time.The second sentence shows an increase in those efforts, suggesting a progression or change over time in the banks' strategies toward this demographic. The relationship is temporal because it describes a sequence of events: first, the banks targeted the elderly, and then they increased their efforts.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Those efforts are being stepped up .||Judie MacDonald , vice president of retail sales at Barnett Banks Inc. of Jacksonville , Fla. , says the company now targets sub-segments within the market by tailoring its popular Seniors Partners Program to various life styles .||The first sentence states that certain efforts are being increased or expanded. The second sentence provides specific details about how those efforts are being expanded through an example: Judie MacDonald explains that Barnett Banks Inc. is targeting sub-segments within the market by customizing its Seniors Partners Program. This detailed example illustrates the expansion of efforts mentioned in the first sentence, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Varying age , geography and life-style differences create numerous sub-markets||individual Barnett branches can add different benefits to their Seniors Partners package -- such as athletic activities or travel clubs -- to appeal to local market interests||The first sentence explains that differing factors like age, geography, and lifestyle result in various sub-markets. The second sentence details a strategy where individual Barnett branches customize the Seniors Partners package with additional benefits to attract local interests. This customization is contingent upon the existence of diverse sub-markets mentioned in the first sentence. The need for branches to adapt their offerings to local preferences is directly related to the variation in sub-markets.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||individual Barnett branches can add different benefits to their Seniors Partners package -- such as athletic activities or travel clubs -- to appeal to local market interests||An active 55-year-old in Boca Raton may care more about Senior Olympic games , while a 75-year-old in Panama City may care more about a seminar on health||The first sentence states that individual Barnett branches can customize the Seniors Partners package with additional benefits to cater to local market interests. The second sentence provides examples of how different age groups in different locations might have varying interests, such as Senior Olympic games for an active 55-year-old in Boca Raton or a health seminar for a 75-year-old in Panama City. The contingency relationship is evident because the potential customizations (additional benefits) depend on the specific interests of the local market. The offerings would vary based on the preferences of the target demographic in each location.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Banks have tried packaging before .||In 1973 , Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco launched the Gold Account , which included free checking , a credit card , safe-deposit box and travelers checks for a $ 3 monthly fee .||The first sentence makes a general statement that banks have attempted packaging services in the past. The second sentence provides a specific example of this practice, detailing a service package introduced by Wells Fargo & Co. in 1973. This example expands on the initial statement by offering concrete details about what packaging entails, including the various services bundled together and the associated cost. Thus, the second sentence expands on the information provided in the first one by giving a specific instance of bank service packaging.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||Many banks , particularly smaller ones , were slow to computerize and could n't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable .||As banks ' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s , the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs .||The first sentence explains that many banks, especially smaller ones, were slow to adopt computerization and thus couldn't effectively target specific market segments to increase profitability. The second sentence discusses a shift in focus for banks during the mid-1970s, when they started prioritizing cost-cutting measures due to squeezed earnings. The temporal relationship indicates that the change in emphasis to cost reduction occurred after the period when banks were slow to computerize. This sequence of events—first the delay in adopting technology, then the shift in strategy—establishes the temporal connection between the two sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||But now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age , income and geography .||They are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s .||The first sentence states that computers are now enabling banks to analyze their customers based on specific criteria (age, income, and geography). The second sentence explains how this capability has improved over time, specifically mentioning that banks are better able to reach these customer segments following deregulation in the late 1970s. The second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by providing additional context about the improvements in targeting customer segments, thus deepening our understanding of the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||They are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s .||Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits , as well as opened up the field for new products such as high-rate CDs .||The first sentence states that entities (likely banks or financial institutions) are better able to reach certain market segments due to deregulation that started in the late 1970s. The second sentence provides more detail about the effects of deregulation, specifically mentioning how it has removed restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits and allowed for new products like high-rate CDs. This additional information expands on the initial statement about the benefits of deregulation, thus establishing an expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits , as well as opened up the field for new products such as high-rate CDs .||Where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account , it began offering money-market accounts , certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking , and staggering rates based on the size of deposits .||The first sentence states that deregulation has removed restrictions on bank deposit rates and allowed for new financial products. The second sentence describes a specific change in banking practices, including the introduction of various types of accounts and variable interest rates. The second sentence explains a consequence of the deregulation mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the occurrence described in the second sentence is contingent upon the event in the first sentence: the changes in banking practices were a direct result of the deregulation.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis and Chemical Banking Corp. of New York extend their market-share battles into small towns across the nation .||Today , a banker is worrying about local , regional and money-center banks , as well as thrifts and credit unions||The first sentence indicates that the competition in the banking industry has become more intense due to large banks expanding their market-share battles into smaller towns. The second sentence describes the current situation where bankers are concerned about various types of financial institutions. The contingency relationship is demonstrated by the fact that the increased intensity of competition (as described in the first sentence) leads to the heightened concerns of bankers (as described in the second sentence). In other words, the concerns of bankers are contingent upon the more intense competition in the industry.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The competition has cultivated a much savvier consumer .||The average household will spread 19 accounts over a dozen financial institutions||The first sentence states that the competition has led to more savvy consumers. The second sentence provides specific details about how consumers behave as a result of becoming savvier: the average household spreads 19 accounts over a dozen financial institutions. This detail expands on what it means to be a savvier consumer, demonstrating the behavior that results from increased savvy. Thus, the relationship is one of expansion, where the second sentence elaborates on the consequences of the situation described in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place .||For their troubles , the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate .||The first sentence explains how packages encourage customer loyalty by offering rewards for doing most of their banking with one institution. The second sentence expands on the benefits of this loyalty by describing what banks gain from it: a more stable customer base less prone to switching for minor changes in interest rates. The second sentence provides additional information about the outcome of the loyalty encouraged by these packages, thus expanding on the initial point.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||For their troubles , the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate .||The more accounts customers have the more likely they are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the bank that offers it .||The first sentence states that banks benefit from having a larger captive audience that is less likely to switch banks for minor changes in interest rates. The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining one reason why customers become more loyal: the more accounts customers have with a bank, the more likely they are to be attracted to bundled services (packages) and remain loyal to the bank providing those services. This further supports the notion that a larger number of accounts per customer contributes to the bank's goal of creating a more loyal customer base.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The more accounts customers have the more likely they are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the bank that offers it .||That can pay off down the road as customers , especially the younger ones , change from borrowers to savers/investors .||The first sentence states that having more accounts makes customers more likely to be attracted to a package and remain loyal to the bank offering it. The second sentence expands on the benefits of this loyalty by explaining a specific way it can pay off for the bank in the future: as customers, particularly younger ones, transition from being borrowers to savers and investors. This transition is a consequence of the loyalty mentioned in the first sentence, hence the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Packaging has some drawbacks .||The additional technology , personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive .||The first sentence introduces the idea that packaging has some drawbacks.The second sentence expands upon this idea by providing specific examples of what those drawbacks might be: the costs associated with additional technology, personnel training, and promotional efforts. Thus, the second sentence offers more detailed information to support the initial claim, creating an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The additional technology , personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive .||Chemical Bank spent more than $ 50 million to introduce its ChemPlus line , several packages aimed at different segments , in 1986 , according to Thomas Jacob , senior vice president of marketing .||The first sentence makes a general statement about the costs associated with implementing new technology, training personnel, and promoting new services. The second sentence provides a specific example of these costs by detailing how much Chemical Bank spent to introduce its ChemPlus line. This specific instance serves to expand upon the initial general statement, illustrating the point that such endeavors can indeed be expensive through real-world evidence. Therefore, the relationship between the sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Chemical Bank spent more than $ 50 million to introduce its ChemPlus line , several packages aimed at different segments , in 1986 , according to Thomas Jacob , senior vice president of marketing .||It 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive , and make it pay||The first sentence states that Chemical Bank invested over $50 million to launch its ChemPlus product line in 1986. The second sentence comments on the difficulty and financial challenge of rolling out such a comprehensive offering. The expansion relationship is evident here because the second sentence provides additional insight and elaboration on the significant investment mentioned in the first sentence, explaining the complexity and financial expectations associated with launching the ChemPlus line.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Still , bankers expect packaging to flourish , primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs .||These days , banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them||The first sentence states that bankers expect packaging to flourish due to customer demand for tailored financial services.The second sentence further elaborates on this point by illustrating how customers now enter banks with the expectation of receiving personalized packages. The second sentence provides additional detail and support for the reason mentioned in the first sentence, hence the expansion relationship. It offers a specific scenario that demonstrates the customer expectation mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||These days , banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them||Some banks are already moving in that direction , according to Alvin T. Sale , marketing director at First Union Corp. in Charlotte .||The first sentence indicates that banking customers now expect personalized services or products tailored specifically for them. The second sentence provides evidence of this trend with specific examples: some banks are indeed shifting toward offering more personalized services, as observed by Alvin T. Sale, a marketing director at First Union Corp. Thus, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by providing real-world examples of banks responding to customer expectations, thereby deepening the understanding of the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Some banks are already moving in that direction , according to Alvin T. Sale , marketing director at First Union Corp. in Charlotte .||First Union now has packages for seven customer groups .||The first sentence states that some banks, including information provided by Alvin T. Sale from First Union Corp., are moving towards a specific direction (implied to be customer-focused marketing). The second sentence provides more detail about First Union Corp. specifically, mentioning that they have packages tailored for seven customer groups. This additional information expands upon the initial statement by giving a concrete example of how First Union Corp. is implementing the mentioned direction. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||First Union now has packages for seven customer groups .||Soon , it will split those into 30 .||The first sentence states that First Union has packages designed for seven customer groups. The second sentence indicates that this number will increase to 30. This demonstrates a comparison through the expansion or increase in the number of customer groups from seven to thirty. The relationship is comparative because it highlights a change in quantity over time.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||it will amend a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to delete a plan to sell 500,000 newly issued common shares||it will resubmit the registration to cover only the 2.3 million warrants , each exercisable for the purchase of one common share||The first sentence states that the entity will amend a registration statement to delete a plan to sell 500,000 newly issued common shares. The second sentence provides additional detail about what the amended registration will include: specifically, it will now cover only the 2.3 million warrants, each exercisable for the purchase of one common share. This additional detail expands upon the information provided in the first sentence, explaining what the registration will encompass after the amendment. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||it will resubmit the registration to cover only the 2.3 million warrants , each exercisable for the purchase of one common share||Currently , ShareData has about 4.1 million common shares outstanding .||The first sentence states that the registration will be resubmitted to cover only 2.3 million warrants, each allowing the purchase of one common share. The second sentence provides additional context about the number of common shares currently outstanding, which is 4.1 million. The second sentence expands on the understanding of the share structure and the significance of the 2.3 million warrants mentioned in the first sentence. It gives more detail about the total number of common shares in circulation, helping to clarify the proportion of shares that the 2.3 million warrants would impact.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves||That builds confidence , self sufficiency , not to mention critical regulatory net worth .||The first sentence states that there are efforts to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves. The second sentence explains the positive outcomes of these efforts, such as building confidence and self-sufficiency, and increasing critical regulatory net worth. The second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by detailing the benefits that result from helping these institutions and employees become more self-reliant.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line .||Every $ 15,000 you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale -- !||The first sentence proposes an action, which is sending support to a savings institution that has faced negative publicity and financial impact. The second sentence then explains the expected outcome of this action: every $15,000 sent will significantly help improve the institution's net worth and employee morale. The relationship is one of contingency because the positive effect (boosting net worth and morale) depends on the proposed action (sending support). The second sentence is contingent upon the first, as it outlines what would happen if the suggested action were to occur.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||that the 30-point circuit breaker , which currently provides only a one-hour respite during market sell-offs , will become the maximum one-day limit for the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract||the one-day limit now is 50 index points||The first sentence introduces a change to the 30-point circuit breaker, stating that it will become the maximum one-day limit for the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract.The second sentence provides context by mentioning the current one-day limit of 50 index points. The comparison relationship is established through the contrast between the new maximum limit (30 points) and the existing limit (50 points). It highlights how the change affects the one-day limit for the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||A final modification was made to the five-point opening limit for the contract .||that five-point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading||The first sentence states that a final modification was made to the five-point opening limit for the contract. The second sentence expands upon this information by specifying when this limit will be in effect - during the first 10 minutes of trading. The second sentence provides additional detail about the context or conditions under which the modified limit applies, thus expanding on the initial statement.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||that five-point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading||The limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening 10 minutes of trading .||The first sentence states that there is a five-point limit that will apply for the first 10 minutes of trading. The second sentence explains what happens to this limit under current rules if the contracts trade above the limit price during the same period - the limit lapses. These two sentences are in comparison as they both discuss the duration and conditions of the five-point limit during the opening 10 minutes of trading. The comparison is between the existence and application of the limit versus the condition under which the limit would cease to apply.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||that the collar , which banned program trades through the Big Board 's computer when the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 50 points , did n't work well||that firms could get around the collar by executing trades manually||The first sentence states that the collar, designed to ban program trades when the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 50 points, did not work well. The second sentence explains how firms could circumvent the collar by executing trades manually. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the second sentence provides a reason or explanation for why the collar did not work well: firms found a workaround by executing trades manually instead of through the Big Board's computer.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||that Mr. Phelan was so `` vague and mushy '' that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could `` come out feeling good||At one point , Mr. Phelan angered the subcommittee 's chairman , Rep. Edward Markey D. , Mass. , by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers .||The first sentence states that Mr. Phelan was described as "vague and mushy," allowing everyone to feel good about the meeting. The second sentence details an instance where Mr. Phelan's lack of new information angered the subcommittee's chairman. The comparison relationship exists because both sentences evaluate Mr. Phelan's communication style in different contexts: the first sentence portrays it positively (everyone feels good), while the second sentence shows a negative outcome (angering the chairman). The two situations contrast, comparing the effects of his communication style.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Synchrony', 'meanwhile'] ||The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door , as members here always have .||In the tower , five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614 .||The first sentence describes an ongoing activity where the parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels church chat at the church door, a tradition that has been consistent over time. The second sentence introduces another activity taking place in the church tower, involving bell ringers pulling on ropes attached to bells that have been there since 1614. The temporal relationship is evident because both activities are happening concurrently but independently within the church grounds. The ongoing nature of the parishioners' tradition and the bell ringing occurring at the same time establishes a temporal connection between the two sentences.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||, St. Michael once had its own `` band '' of ringers , who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service .||Now , only one local ringer remains : 64-year-old Derek Hammond .||The first sentence tells us about the past situation where St. Michael had a "band" of ringers who would perform at specific times. The second sentence then introduces the current situation with only one local ringer remaining, Derek Hammond. The relationship between the two sentences is comparative because they contrast the number of ringers in the past with the present, highlighting the change from multiple ringers to just one.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||To ring for even one service at this tower , we have to scrape||`` We 've tried to train the youngsters , but they have their discos and their dances , and they just drift away . ''||The first sentence indicates a need or difficulty in finding people to ring the bells at the tower.The second sentence provides a reason for this challenge: attempts to train young people have been unsuccessful because they are more interested in other activities (discos and dances).Thus, the reason for having to "scrape" to find bell ringers is contingent upon the failure to engage and train the younger generation due to their interests lying elsewhere.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||History , after all , is not on his side .||According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago , nearly a third of England 's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them .||The first sentence makes a general statement suggesting that circumstances are unfavorable for the subject, likely referring to the tradition or practice of ringing church bells in this context. The second sentence provides specific information that supports this notion, detailing the results of a survey that show a significant decline in the ringing of church bells due to a lack of bell ringers. Thus, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first by offering concrete evidence of the unfavorable situation faced by the tradition.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes .||The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells , as do the carillons of continental Europe , is considered by the English to be childish , fit only for foreigners .||The first sentence states that the ancient art is struggling ("on the ropes"). The second sentence provides more detail about the context of this struggle, specifically mentioning the "less complicated version" of playing tunes on bells, referring to carillons, and how the English view this practice as childish and suitable only for foreigners. This additional information expands on the initial statement about the ancient art's struggles by giving specific reasons for its decline in esteem among the English, thereby elaborating on the challenges faced by the ancient art.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells , as do the carillons of continental Europe , is considered by the English to be childish , fit only for foreigners .||Change-ringing , a mind-boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago , requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration .||The first sentence describes the English perception of playing tunes on bells (as done by carillons in continental Europe) as being less complicated and somewhat disdainfully viewed as childish and suitable only for foreigners. The second sentence introduces change-ringing, an activity invented by the English, which requires significant skill and concentration. The comparison is established through contrasting the simpler, less respected method of playing bells with the complex and demanding practice of change-ringing, both in terms of the level of skill required and the cultural attitudes toward each.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||Then , at a signal , the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking .||Each variation , or change , can occur only once||The first sentence describes the action of ringers changing the order of bell sounds upon a signal while maintaining a steady rhythm. The second sentence adds specific details about the nature of these variations, stating that each variation can only occur once. This additional information expands on the description of how the variations work, providing more detail about the constraints placed on the sequence of sounds. Thus, the second sentence is in an expansion relationship with the first one, offering supplementary information about the variations mentioned.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved .||Ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle , one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter 's stance , each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber . No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling . Totally absorbed , the ringers stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision they call it `` rope-sight '' to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls .||The first sentence provides an overview of a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church, indicating that it involves significant work. The subsequent text expands upon this idea by describing specific details of the practice, including the positions and actions of the ringers, the sound of the ropes, and the use of "rope-sight." This detailed description elaborates on the initial statement about the amount of work involved, providing a clearer picture of what the practice entails. Therefore, the relationship is one of expansion, where more information is given to support and develop the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle , one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter 's stance , each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber .||No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling .||The first sentence describes the scene of ten shirt-sleeved ringers standing in a circle, each pulling a rope that goes through the ceiling of the ringing chamber. The second sentence provides additional details about the atmosphere of the scene, noting the silence and the sound of the ropes moving, which is compared to the muffled sound of the bells. This additional information expands on the initial description of the scene, enhancing our understanding of the environment and the actions taking place within it. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling .||Totally absorbed , the ringers stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision they call it `` rope-sight '' to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls .||The first sentence sets the scene, describing a silent environment where the movement of ropes creates a noticeable sound alongside the muffled bells. The second sentence elaborates on the context by explaining how the ringers focus and use a specific technique ("rope-sight") to coordinate their actions without speaking. This additional detail expands on the initial description of the quiet, focused atmosphere among the bell ringers. The second sentence adds depth to the first by providing insight into the ringers' method of communication and coordination, hence the expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||In a well-known detective-story involving church bells , English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion that finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . ''||Ringers are `` filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed . ''||The first sentence introduces Dorothy L. Sayers' description of the passion for ringing church bells in a detective story. The second sentence elaborates on this passion by describing how ringers feel while performing the ritual. The contingency relationship is established because the second sentence provides additional information (the feelings of the ringers) based on the context set by the first sentence (the nature of the passion). The deeper explanation of the ringers' experience is contingent upon the initial introduction of the concept of bell-ringing as a passion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||It is a passion that usually stays in the tower , however .||More often than not , ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry .||The first sentence indicates that the passion (likely related to bell ringing) typically remains within the context of the tower. The second sentence elaborates on this idea by explaining how ringers often perceive the church as secondary to the belfry, focusing more on the act of ringing itself. This further illustrates the idea from the first sentence that the passion for ringing is largely confined to the tower environment. The second sentence expands on the concept introduced in the first sentence by providing additional details about the ringers' perspective.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling , strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services .||Two years ago , the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone , vicar of Great Torrington , Devon , got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he sacked the entire band||The first sentence outlines the broader issue of church membership decline and how some vicars are responding to this by pressuring bell ringers to attend services. The second sentence provides a specific instance of this behavior, detailing the actions of the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone, who dismissed his entire band of ringers for not attending services. This particular example serves as an expansion of the general trend described in the first sentence, offering a concrete illustration of the measures taken by certain vicars.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||Two years ago , the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone , vicar of Great Torrington , Devon , got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he sacked the entire band||the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest||The first sentence indicates that the vicar, Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone, took action due to his dissatisfaction with the ringers who did not attend services. The second sentence describes the response of the ringers, which was to set up a picket line in protest. The relationship is one of contingency because the action of the ringers (protesting) directly followed and was a reaction to the vicar's decision to sack the entire band. The protest is contingent upon the vicar's prior action.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar||So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come the ringers from above , making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer||The first sentence states there is a problem with the stairs from the bell tower, which are located next to the altar. The second sentence describes the noisy and disruptive exit of the bell ringers using those same stairs during a prayer. The second sentence expands on the issue mentioned in the first by providing a specific scenario where the problem with the stairs becomes evident, thus creating an expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church||`` I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life . ''||The first sentence describes the effect of the sound of bells, which is to draw people into the church. The second sentence expresses a hope related to the bell ringers being drawn into a fuller life. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the hope expressed in the second sentence is contingent upon the effect described in the first sentence. Specifically, the hope relies on the idea that if the sound of bells can draw others into the church, perhaps it could also influence the bell ringers in a similar positive way.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers , a sort of parliament of ringing groups , aims to improve relations with vicars||It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care . ''||The first sentence states that the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers aims to improve relations with vicars. The second sentence details specific actions they plan to take to achieve this goal: speaking to students at theological colleges about bell ringing and publishing a booklet for every vicar in the country. These actions expand upon the initial statement of improving relations, providing concrete steps that support and elaborate on the council's aim. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care . ''||We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience||The first sentence outlines an initiative to engage with theological college students and vicars about bell ringing. The second sentence expresses recognition of potentially reduced priority in church life. The contingency relationship is demonstrated as follows: The initiative to reach out and promote bell ringing among students and vicars (as described in the first sentence) is contingent upon the recognition that bell ringing may no longer hold the same level of importance in church activities. This suggests that the actions being taken are a response to the perceived decrease in priority, aiming to re-engage and highlight the value of bell ringing within the church community.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Mr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem : lack of ringers .||One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today , only 40,000 of them still ring .||The first sentence introduces that Mr. Baldwin is addressing the issue of a lack of ringers. The second sentence provides more detail about the extent of this problem by giving specific numbers from a survey. This additional information expands upon the initial statement by quantifying the shortage of bellringers, thereby providing more context and supporting data for the problem Mr. Baldwin is tackling. Thus, the second sentence has an expansion relationship with the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||But the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful||Right now , we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10||The first sentence states that the council's program for attracting and training ringers has had only limited success.The second sentence expands upon this notion by providing specific details about the extent of this success: after five years, they are fortunate to retain one out of every ten new ringers. This detail further explains the meaning of "only partly successful" by quantifying the level of retention. Thus, the second sentence provides additional information that clarifies and elaborates on the limited success mentioned in the first sentence, creating an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field||more than a third of the ringers today are women||The first sentence states that a positive development is the increasing number of women entering a field previously dominated by men. The second sentence quantifies this development by specifying that over a third of today's participants are women. The second sentence expands upon the first by providing specific evidence (the proportion of women) to support the claim that more women are now participating in this field.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||They are n't accepted everywhere , however .||The oldest bell-ringing group in the country , the Ancient Society of College Youths , founded in 1637 , remains male-only , .||The first sentence states that something (implied to be the acceptance of women in bell-ringing societies) is not universal. The second sentence provides a specific example of this non-universal acceptance by mentioning the Ancient Society of College Youths, which is male-only. This example expands on the initial statement by giving concrete evidence of a place where women are not accepted, thus supporting the claim made in the first sentence. The relationship is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds detail to the general statement made in the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , '' a weekly newspaper for ringers .||One writer , signing his letter as `` Red-blooded , balanced male , '' remarked on the `` frequency of women fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings . ''||The first sentence introduces the topic of a problem related to gender issues within the community of bell ringers, which was discussed in a series of letters to "The Ringing World." The second sentence provides specific details about one of those letters, including a quote from a writer who expressed particular views on the roles of women in bell ringing. This detail expands on the nature of the problem mentioned in the first sentence by giving an example of the kind of issues being raised in the letters. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by offering a concrete illustration of the content of the letters.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||, one woman ringer from Solihull observed that `` the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired : . ''||Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing , `` I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry .||The first sentence presents a statement made by a woman ringer from Solihull criticizing the average male ringer. The second sentence introduces another woman's perspective, sharing her experience in ringing, which adds to the critique of male ringers by noting that she has never seen a woman faint while ringing. Both statements are critical of male ringers and support each other, with the second expanding on the first by providing additional evidence or perspective.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||that in her 60 years of ringing , `` I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry||I have seen one or two men die , bless them .||The first sentence states that the speaker has never seen a lady faint in the belfry during their 60 years of ringing. The second sentence contrasts this by mentioning that the speaker has witnessed one or two men die in the same setting. These two statements are compared to highlight the difference in experiences regarding the physical reactions of women versus men in the context of bell ringing. The comparison is drawn through the contrast between the lack of fainting among ladies and the more severe outcomes for some men.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||That can be a trap for unwary investors||Strong dividend growth is `` the black widow of valuation '' -- .||The first sentence warns about a potential trap for unwary investors. The second sentence provides more specific information about what makes this a trap: strong dividend growth being compared to "the black widow of valuation". This comparison serves as an elaboration or clarification of the warning in the first sentence, explaining why it can be particularly deceptive or dangerous. Thus, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, providing further detail or consequence related to the initial warning.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time||Invariably , those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments||The first sentence indicates that companies increase their payouts significantly after the economy and corporate profits have grown for a while. The second sentence states that strong economic periods always lead to recessionary times. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that the strong economic periods mentioned in the first sentence inevitably transition into recessions, as stated in the second sentence. Thus, the occurrence of a recession (second sentence) is contingent upon the occurrence of a strong economic period (first sentence).
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||In 1976 , for example , dividends on the stocks in Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index soared 10 % , following much slower growth the year before .||The S&P index started sliding in price in September 1976 , .||The first sentence describes the significant increase (10%) in dividend growth for stocks in the S&P 500 index in 1976, following a period of slower growth.The second sentence describes a different event in 1976: the S&P index started to decline in price in September. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the positive event (dividend growth) with the negative event (index price decline), both occurring within the same year. This contrast highlights the variability in the stock market's performance during 1976.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious .||Payouts on the S&P 500 stocks rose 10 % in 1988 , according to Standard & Poor 's Corp. , and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9 % and 14 % .||The first sentence states that recent strong growth in dividends causes anxiety among some market watchers. The second sentence provides more specific information about the growth in payouts on the S&P 500 stocks, including the percentage increase in 1988 and estimated growth for 1989. This detailed information expands on the initial claim of strong dividend growth, explaining why market watchers might be anxious. The expansion relationship is established by providing additional context and data that support the general statement made in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||, the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay||They are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S&P 500 .||The first sentence indicates that the decline in yield signifies stocks are becoming expensive compared to their dividends.The second sentence shows an action taken in response to this situation: they are monitoring the S&P 500 yield closely. Thus, the action of keeping a close watch is contingent upon the observation of the decline in yield and its implications for stock prices.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||In fact , `` the market has always tanked .||Always .||The first sentence states that "the market has always tanked," suggesting a consistent historical pattern of the market performing poorly. The second sentence, "Always," reinforces and expands upon this idea by emphasizing that this poor performance is a constant and unchanging characteristic of the market. The use of "always" in the second sentence serves to strengthen the claim made in the first sentence, providing additional emphasis and detail to support the assertion that the market consistently tanks.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Always .||There 's never been an exception .||The first sentence asserts that something is always the case.The second sentence reinforces this idea by stating there has never been an exception to this rule. The second sentence expands on the first by providing additional information that supports the claim of consistency made in the first sentence, hence forming an expansion relationship.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||The last time the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3 % was in the summer of 1987 .||Stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle .||The first sentence sets a historical context by mentioning when the S&P 500 yield last dropped below 3%, which is summer of 1987. The second sentence refers to stockholders taking action and selling shares before "the October debacle," which is likely referring to Black Monday, the stock market crash that occurred in October 1987. The temporal relationship is evident here as the second event (stockholders selling shares and avoiding the crash) is positioned chronologically after the first event (the drop in yield).
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Still , some market analysts say the current 3.3 % reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past .||It 's not a very meaningful indicator currently||The first sentence indicates that there are market analysts who believe the current 3.3% reading is less troublesome than it would have been in previous years. The second sentence explains that the indicator isn't very meaningful at present. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here by the fact that the analysts' view of the current reading being less troublesome is based on the condition that the indicator itself is not very meaningful currently. The opinion about the reading's impact is contingent upon the perceived lack of meaning in the indicator at this time.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||Rather than increasing dividends , some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares||He factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6 % .||The first sentence explains a scenario where companies use cash for share buybacks instead of increasing dividends. The second sentence introduces an action taken based on the described scenario: factoring this situation into the market yield calculation. Thus, the action (factoring the share buyback approach into the market yield) is contingent upon the scenario (companies preferring share buybacks over dividend increases). The relationship indicates that the calculation adjustment is a direct response to the observed behavior of companies, making it a contingent relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||PaineWebber Inc. , for instance , is forecasting growth in S&P 500 dividends of just under 5 % in 1990 , down from an estimated 11 % this year .||In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4 % to a decline of 1 % , according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger||The first sentence states PaineWebber Inc.'s forecast for S&P 500 dividend growth in 1990, which is expected to be around 5%, compared to an estimated 11% in the current year. The second sentence provides historical context by mentioning the range of dividend changes during previous moderate economic slowdowns, as reported by PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger, with gains as high as 4% and declines as low as 1%. These sentences establish a comparison by relating the projected 1990 dividend growth to historical dividend changes during similar economic conditions.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Dividend growth on the order of 12 % is expected by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs .||that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures||The first sentence indicates that both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs expect dividend growth of around 12%.The second sentence provides context for why such expectations might exist, namely that corporations have excess cash after paying dividends and making capital expenditures. The expectation of dividend growth (12%) is contingent upon the financial situation of corporations having extra cash. This relationship suggests that the dividend growth forecast is based on the current financial conditions of the companies.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||One indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends .||A total of 139 companies raised dividends in October , basically unchanged from 138 a year ago||The first sentence introduces the idea that investors should monitor the monthly count by Standard & Poor's of firms changing their dividends. The second sentence provides specific data for October, stating that 139 companies increased their dividends, which is similar to the previous year's figure. This detail serves to expand on the initial suggestion by offering an example of the kind of information that would be tracked. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by providing an instance of the type of information that the monthly tally would include.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||A total of 139 companies raised dividends in October , basically unchanged from 138 a year ago||That followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace .||The first sentence states that 139 companies raised dividends in October, a number nearly identical to the previous year's figure of 138 companies. The second sentence discusses the trend over the previous four months, noting that dividend increases were lower than in the corresponding periods of the previous year. The comparison relationship is evident because the text contrasts the stability in dividend raises in October with the decline observed in the preceding months, highlighting a change in trend.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||In any case , opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels .||Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a 12 % to 15 % total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- .||The first sentence states that opinions vary on the extent to which the stock market would benefit from continued double-digit dividend growth. The second sentence provides a specific viewpoint from Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs, who estimates a 12% to 15% total return for the stock market over the next year. This detail expands on the idea that there are differing opinions regarding the impact of dividend growth on the stock market, offering one expert's prediction as part of the broader discussion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||But Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price , who also expects 12 % growth in dividends next year , does n't think it will help the overall market all that much .||Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook , but I do n't think it 's a main consideration||In the first sentence, Mr. Boesel believes that while dividend growth will occur, it won't significantly impact the overall market. The second sentence expands on this perspective by explaining what he means: dividend increases support the market outlook, but they aren't the primary factor driving market considerations. The second sentence provides additional details about Mr. Boesel's viewpoint, elaborating on how he sees dividends influencing the market, hence forming an expansionary relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook , but I do n't think it 's a main consideration||With slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year , `` I would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels .||The first sentence states that while dividend increases support the market outlook, they are not the primary factor.The second sentence then presents a scenario with slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings, predicting little market growth under these conditions. The relationship is one of contingency because the speaker's prediction of limited market growth (second sentence) is contingent upon the scenario of slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings. This scenario provides context for why dividend increases alone are not expected to significantly boost the market.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Such is hardly the case .||Bell 's father-in-law , Gardner G. Hubbard , wealthy and well-connected , obtained financing to start the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston , .||The first sentence asserts that "such is hardly the case," indicating a contrast or difference from some expectation or claim. The second sentence provides information about Bell's father-in-law, Gardner G. Hubbard, obtaining financing for the American Bell Telephone Company. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting an unspecified expectation or claim with the fact that Hubbard, who was wealthy and well-connected, successfully secured funding for the company. The contrast suggests that the reality of Hubbard's actions and success differs from whatever was expected or claimed previously.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Western Union indeed wanted to get into the telephone business .||It acquired Thomas Edison 's microphone patent and then immediately sued the Bell Co. claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather , Emile Berliner , which had been sold to Bell for a princely $ 50,000 , infringed upon Western Union 's Edison patent .||The first sentence states that Western Union wanted to enter the telephone business. The second sentence explains how they attempted to do so: by acquiring Thomas Edison's microphone patent and suing the Bell Company over alleged infringement of this patent with Emile Berliner's invention. The second sentence expands on the first by providing specific actions taken by Western Union in pursuit of its goal to enter the telephone industry.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||it will eliminate 266 jobs at its Boulder headquarters , 176 field sales jobs and 50 jobs at its Canadian and United Kingdom headquarters||The company 's work force will fall to about 400 people .||The first sentence states that the company will be eliminating a specific number of jobs at various locations. The second sentence informs us that, as a result of these eliminations, the company's workforce will decrease to around 400 people. The reduction in workforce size is contingent upon the job eliminations mentioned earlier. The company's decision to cut jobs leads directly to a smaller workforce, demonstrating a cause-and-effect relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||We flat ran out of financing resources||`` We had to do something structurally and radically different . ''||The first sentence indicates that the speaker and their team exhausted their financing resources. The second sentence explains the action taken in response to this situation: they decided to make a significant and fundamental change. Thus, the decision to undertake a "structurally and radically different" approach is contingent upon the lack of financing resources. The need for a radical change arose because of the financial situation, creating a contingent relationship between the two statements.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||NBI will focus on servicing its installed base of systems , trying to provide maintenance for other manufacturers and expanding its software business , using some of the applications it developed for its hardware||The company currently offers a word-processing package for personal computers called Legend .||The first sentence outlines NBI's strategies, including expanding its software business using applications developed for its hardware. The second sentence introduces a specific product, a word-processing package named Legend, which fits within the strategy of expanding the software business. The relationship is one of expansion because the mention of the word-processing package exemplifies part of the broader strategy outlined in the first sentence, demonstrating how NBI is implementing its plan to expand its software business.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||One official newspaper , Legal Daily , even directly criticized Mr. Nixon , who is normally referred to here as an `` old friend . ''||The paper accused him of being a leading proponent of `` peaceful evolution , '' a catch phrase to describe what China believes is the policy of Western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere .||The first sentence states that an official newspaper, Legal Daily, criticized Mr. Nixon and mentioned that he is usually referred to as an "old friend." The second sentence expands on the nature of this criticism by explaining that the paper accused Nixon of promoting "peaceful evolution," which is described further as a strategy to convert socialist nations to capitalism. Thus, the second sentence provides additional details about the criticism mentioned in the first sentence, expanding on the context and nature of the critique.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Many in the United States , including many friends of China , believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified||`` The events of April through June damaged the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of China . ''||The first sentence states that many people in the United States, including friends of China, believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified. The second sentence elaborates on this by explaining the impact of the events: they damaged the respect and confidence that most Americans had for Chinese leaders. The expansion relationship is shown as follows: The second sentence provides additional information and context about the consequences of the crackdown mentioned in the first sentence, expanding on the idea that the crackdown led to a significant change in perception among Americans.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The Chinese responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion .||In talks with Mr. Nixon , Chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings , and even suggested that the U.S. was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring .||The first sentence states that the Chinese responded in an undiplomatic manner. The second sentence provides specific details about how they did so: during talks with Mr. Nixon, they showed no remorse for the killings and even implicated the U.S. in the demonstrations. The second sentence expands on the first by giving concrete examples of the undiplomatic behavior mentioned, thereby providing more information about what "responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion" means.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||that the U.S. was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring||Frankly speaking , the U.S. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago||The first sentence states that the U.S. had prominent involvement in the demonstrations that took place in the spring. The second sentence expands upon this idea by specifying the nature and context of the involvement, referring to it as "too deeply" and characterizing the events as "turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion" that occurred in Beijing. The second sentence provides additional details and a more specific description of the U.S.'s involvement, thus expanding on the information provided in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Frankly speaking , the U.S. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago||China was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove China for it . ''||In the first sentence, the speaker asserts that the U.S. was deeply involved in recent events in Beijing, referring to them as turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion. The second sentence provides additional context and justification for the initial claim, stating that China was the real victim and that it is unjust to criticize China for these events. This second sentence expands on the idea presented in the first sentence by explaining why the U.S.'s involvement is problematic from the speaker's perspective and why China should not be held responsible.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Mr. Nixon is traveling in China as a private citizen , but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the Bush administration .||Mr. Nixon met Mr. Bush and his national security adviser , Brent Scowcroft , before coming to China on Saturday .||The first sentence states that Mr. Nixon is in China as a private citizen but is serving as an unofficial envoy for the Bush administration. The second sentence expands on this role by providing additional context about his interactions with the administration prior to his trip. Specifically, it explains that Mr. Nixon met with President Bush and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft before departing for China. This meeting likely helped establish the nature of his unofficial envoy status, reinforcing the idea that he had some level of official backing or guidance for his visit. Thus, the second sentence expands on the information presented in the first by adding detail about the preparatory meetings Mr. Nixon had with key officials from the Bush administration.

The second sentence lists some of the specific issues discussed, including China's economic policies, human rights, and the case of Mr. Fang. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by providing more detail about what was meant by "controversial issues," making the relationship between the two sentences one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||, China 's leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas .||Ideas are going over borders , and there 's no SDI ideological weapon that can shoot them down||The first sentence states that China's leaders need to accept their nation's place in the world community and embrace external influences. The second sentence talks about the free flow of ideas across borders, suggesting nothing can stop them. The expansion relationship is evident as the second sentence expands on the theme of openness and exchange introduced in the first sentence by emphasizing the unstoppable nature of idea-sharing, reinforcing the idea of embracing external contacts and ideas.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||But in one minor matter , Mr. Nixon appears to have gained a concession .||that he hoped he would n't encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the U.S. Embassy||The first sentence indicates that Mr. Nixon achieved a concession in a minor matter. The second sentence provides more detail about what that minor matter was specifically: hoping not to encounter guards with machine guns at the U.S. Embassy. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the minor matter mentioned in the first sentence by specifying what exactly Mr. Nixon was hoping for and in what context (his visit to the U.S. Embassy). This additional information broadens our understanding of the concession Mr. Nixon sought and obtained.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Moreover , police and soldiers continue to harass Americans , who have filed several protests with the Foreign Ministry in the past week .||Several times , Chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of U.S. diplomats and clicked the trigger .||The first sentence states that police and soldiers continue to harass Americans, who have filed protests with the Foreign Ministry. The second sentence provides a specific instance of such harassment: Chinese guards pointing rifles at young children of U.S. diplomats and clicking the trigger. The second sentence expands on the type of harassment mentioned in the first sentence by giving a detailed example, thus deepening the understanding of what "harassment" means in this context.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Industrial companies are accusing financial institutions of jeopardizing Japan 's economy by raising the salary stakes for new employees||The Japanese industrial companies should know better .||The first sentence presents the viewpoint of industrial companies accusing financial institutions of harming Japan's economy by increasing salaries for new hires. The second sentence offers a critical perspective suggesting that the Japanese industrial companies should be more aware or knowledgeable about the situation. The comparison relationship here is established through the critique or judgment of the industrial companies' stance, implying that they should have a better understanding of the consequences or dynamics involved in the situation.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Takuma Yamamoto , president of Fujitsu Ltd. , believes `` the ` money worship ' among young people ... caused the problem . ''||He is just passing the buck to young people .||In the first sentence, Takuma Yamamoto attributes the issue to "money worship" among young people. In the second sentence, it is stated that he is "just passing the buck to young people." Both sentences discuss how Yamamoto relates responsibility for a problem to young people. Therefore, the second sentence compares Yamamoto's act of blaming young people for problems to "passing the buck," illustrating a comparison relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||He is just passing the buck to young people .||What 's wrong with asking for more money ?||The first sentence states that someone is passing the responsibility (or blame) to young people. The second sentence questions the issue with asking for more money. These sentences are compared in terms of avoiding responsibility: "passing the buck" is an idiom meaning to avoid responsibility, similar to how one might avoid addressing the direct issue of asking for more money. Both situations involve deflecting or avoiding a direct responsibility or confrontation, establishing a comparison through the theme of avoidance.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||What 's wrong with asking for more money ?||Money is not everything , but it is necessary , and business is not volunteer work .||The first sentence questions the issue with asking for more money, suggesting some may see it as problematic. The second sentence supports the idea of seeking more money by emphasizing its necessity and distinguishing business from volunteer work. The second sentence provides reasoning to justify the stance taken in the first sentence, thus creating a contingent relationship. The justification for asking for more money is provided as a response to the potential criticism implied in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Money is not everything , but it is necessary , and business is not volunteer work .||It is not unethical to choose a higher-salaried job .||The first sentence asserts that while money isn't everything, it is necessary, and business isn't volunteer work, implying that earning money is a valid and essential part of business and life. The second sentence specifically states that it's not unethical to choose a job with a higher salary. This sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by providing an example of a situation where pursuing more money is justified, reinforcing the notion that seeking financial gain is not inherently wrong.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Unfortunately , Japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages .||I get the impression that some Japanese managers believe working harder for less money is beautiful .||The first sentence states that Japanese manufacturers lack both good working conditions and good compensation packages. The second sentence suggests a possible reason for these issues: some Japanese managers may hold the belief that working harder for less money is admirable. This belief could contribute to the poor working conditions and compensation mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by providing a potential cultural or managerial perspective that explains why the conditions described in the first sentence exist.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.List', 'and'] ||If the Japanese companies are seriously considering their survival , they could do at least three things to improve the situation : raise salaries higher than those of financial institutions ; ; .||improve working conditions ,||The first sentence introduces the idea that if Japanese companies are seriously thinking about their survival, they could undertake certain actions. The second sentence begins with "improve working conditions," which is an additional suggestion for what they can do. This second point expands on the initial claim by offering another specific step that could contribute to improving the situation, hence establishing an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.List', 'and'] ||If the Japanese companies are seriously considering their survival , they could do at least three things to improve the situation : raise salaries higher than those of financial institutions ; improve working conditions better offices and more vacations , for example ;||accept and hire more labor from outside Japan .||The first sentence suggests that if Japanese companies are thinking about their survival, they should consider taking certain actions. The following sentences list specific actions they could take. These actions (raising salaries, improving working conditions, and hiring more foreign labor) all contribute to the overall idea of what the companies could do to improve their situation. Therefore, the relationship between the sentences is one of expansion, where additional information is provided to support or elaborate on the initial suggestion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Among professionals , 76 % have a favorable opinion of her , compared to 62 % who approve of her husband 's performance .||While a quarter of black voters disapprove of Mr. Bush 's handling of his job , only 15 % have a negative view of his spouse . ''||The first sentence provides statistics about the favorable opinions of two individuals (a woman and her husband) among professionals. The second sentence presents more detailed information about the opinions of the same two individuals, but specifically among black voters. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence expands on the first by providing a more specific subset of the group mentioned in the first sentence (i.e., black voters within the group of professionals). It gives additional detail about the opinions held within a particular subgroup.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious , stereotyped perspective .||Why are we blacks continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator .||The first sentence states that an editorial point of view perpetuates a harmful, stereotypical perspective. The second sentence provides a specific instance or elaboration of the type of perspective being referred to, focusing on how it affects the perception of black people. Here, the second sentence expands on the concept introduced in the first sentence by illustrating the impact of such perspectives on a particular group (blacks) and emphasizing the issue of being defined by one's minority status and negative stereotypes. This expansion helps clarify the nature of the "insidious, stereotyped perspective" mentioned earlier.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Neither First Securities , of Beverly Hills , nor Mr. Vargas could be reached for comment .||A telephone-information operator had no listing for either party .||The first sentence states that neither First Securities, of Beverly Hills, nor Mr. Vargas could be reached for comment. The second sentence provides additional information to support the inability to reach them: a telephone-information operator had no listing for either party. This additional detail explains why they couldn't be reached, expanding on the original statement by specifying the method attempted and its failure. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more context about the attempts to contact the parties mentioned.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Triton Securities , of Danville , Calif. , and a principal of the firm , Delwin George Chase , also of Danville , were jointly fined $ 10,000 and given 30-day suspensions as part of a settlement .||While neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing , Triton and Mr. Chase consented to findings of violations in connection with limited-partnership sales .||The first sentence states that Triton Securities and Delwin George Chase were fined and given suspensions as part of a settlement. The second sentence explains more details about the situation: Triton and Mr. Chase did not admit or deny wrongdoing, but they consented to findings of violations related to limited-partnership sales. This additional information expands upon the initial statement of the fine and suspension, providing context for why these actions were taken. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence provides further detail about the circumstances leading to the penalties mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||Officials of Triton could n't be reached for comment .||Mr. Chase did n't return a telephone call to his office .||The first sentence states that officials of Triton couldn't be reached for comment. The second sentence provides additional information about a specific official, Mr. Chase, who didn't return a telephone call to his office. The second sentence expands on the first by giving a specific example of an official who was unreachable, thus supporting the initial statement that Triton officials couldn't be reached.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Crane & Co. Securities Inc. , of Mount Clemens , Mich. , and its president , Glenn R. Crane , of Sterling Heights , Mich. , consented to a joint fine of $ 10,000 .||Without admitting or denying wrongdoing , they consented to findings of violations of escrow and record-keeping rules .||The first sentence states that Crane & Co. Securities Inc. and its president, Glenn R. Crane, agreed to pay a joint fine of $10,000.The second sentence provides additional details about the circumstances under which they agreed to the fine, specifically that they did so without admitting or denying wrongdoing and that the findings were related to violations of escrow and record-keeping rules. This additional information expands on the context of the agreement to the fine mentioned in the first sentence, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Also , Mr. Canepa received a two-week suspension `` in a principal capacity . ''||Without admitting or denying wrongdoing , they consented to findings that they had inaccurately represented the firm 's net capital , maintained inaccurate books and records , and made other violations .||The first sentence states that Mr. Canepa received a two-week suspension in a principal capacity.The second sentence provides additional details about the context of the suspension, specifically that Mr. Canepa and others did not admit or deny wrongdoing but consented to findings of specific violations, including inaccurate representation of the firm's net capital, maintaining inaccurate books and records, and other violations.These additional details expand upon the reason for the suspension mentioned in the first sentence, thus creating an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Weatherly Securities Corp. , New York , and three of its principals -- Dell Eugene Keehn and William Northy Prater Jr. , both of Mercer Island , Wash. , and Thomas Albert McFall , of Red Bank , N.J . -- consented to a fine of $ 20,000 .||Without admitting or denying wrongdoing , they consented to findings that they failed to return funds owed to customers in connection with a limited-partnership offering .||The first sentence states that Weatherly Securities Corp. and three of its principals consented to a fine of $20,000.The second sentence provides more details about the reason for this consent, specifically that they did so without admitting or denying wrongdoing and that they consented to findings regarding failure to return funds owed to customers in a specific context (a limited-partnership offering).The second sentence expands upon the first by giving additional information about the circumstances under which the consent to the fine occurred, hence the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||An implication that we failed to return investor funds is inappropriate and inaccurate||He described the situation as `` an escrow problem , a timing issue , '' which he said was rapidly rectified , with no losses to customers .||The first sentence states that any suggestion that the company did not return investor funds is incorrect. The second sentence provides more detail about the situation, describing it as an escrow problem and a timing issue that was quickly resolved without any loss to customers. This additional information expands on the initial claim by offering specifics about the nature of the problem and its resolution, thus explaining why the implication mentioned in the first sentence is inaccurate. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||W.N. Whelen & Co. , of Georgetown , Del. , and its president , William N. Whelen Jr. , also of Georgetown , were barred from transacting principal trades for 90 days and were jointly fined $ 15,000 .||The firm and Mr. Whelen allegedly sold securities to the public at unfair prices , among other alleged violations .||The first sentence states that W.N. Whelen & Co. and its president, William N. Whelen Jr., were barred from transacting principal trades and were fined. The second sentence explains one reason for these penalties: the firm and Mr. Whelen allegedly sold securities to the public at unfair prices and committed other violations. Thus, the sanctions imposed in the first sentence are contingent upon the alleged actions detailed in the second sentence. The penalties were a consequence of the alleged misconduct.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||that the examination practices of the NASD need improvement||The firm and the NASD differ over the meaning of markup and markdown||The first sentence states that there is an issue with the examination practices of the NASD needing improvement. The second sentence provides additional context or detail about the nature of the disagreement between the firm and the NASD, specifically regarding the interpretation of markup and markdown. This detail helps expand our understanding of what aspect of the examination practices needs improvement, indicating an expansionary relationship where the second sentence elaborates on the problem mentioned in the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , New York , which is 62%-owned by American Express Co. , consented to a $ 10,000 fine .||Without admitting or denying wrongdoing , the firm consented to findings that it failed to respond `` in a timely manner '' to the NASD 's requests for information in connection with a customer complaint .||The first sentence states that Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. agreed to a $10,000 fine.The second sentence provides more detail about the reason for this agreement, specifying that the firm did not admit or deny wrongdoing but consented to the finding that it had failed to respond in a timely manner to the NASD's requests for information related to a customer complaint. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving specific context for the fine.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The following individuals were fined as indicated and barred from association with NASD members , or , where noted , suspended .||Except where noted , none of these people could be reached for comment or had any comment .||The first sentence states that certain individuals were fined, barred from association, and in some cases, suspended. The second sentence adds information that, except where noted, these individuals either could not be reached for comment or had no comment to make. The second sentence expands on the first by providing additional details about the individuals' responses or lack thereof following the actions taken against them. Thus, the second sentence offers supplementary information that enhances our understanding of the situation described in the first sentence, creating an expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||he `` screwed up '' because he did n't realize he was breaking securities laws||Insurance agents have been forced by their companies into becoming registered reps but they are not providing compliance and security-type training so that we can avoid stupid mistakes . ''||The first sentence indicates someone made a mistake due to a lack of awareness about securities laws. The second sentence explains a situation where insurance agents are pushed into roles without adequate training, leading to "stupid mistakes." The contingency relationship is established because the context implies that the lack of proper training and support for insurance agents (second sentence) could be the reason behind someone making a mistake (first sentence). The mistake is contingent upon the inadequate training and support provided.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||I was n't ever actively engaged in any securities activities||`` I never had any clients at all .||The first sentence states that the speaker was not actively engaged in any securities activities. The second sentence provides additional detail by specifying that the speaker never had any clients at all. The second sentence expands on the first by giving a specific reason for the lack of active engagement in securities activities (i.e., having no clients). Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds more information to support or clarify the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||`` I never had any clients at all .||It was just a stupid mistake to get the license .||The first sentence states that the speaker never had any clients.The second sentence explains why this situation occurred, attributing it to a "stupid mistake" in getting the license. The second sentence expands on the reason behind the situation described in the first sentence, providing additional context or justification for the lack of clients. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Government officials , especially in Japan , probably would resist any onslaught of program trading by players trying to shrug off the U.S. furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business .||Japan is `` very concerned '' about the possible effects of program trading||The first sentence indicates that government officials, particularly those in Japan, would likely resist an increase in program trading activities.The second sentence states that Japan is "very concerned" about the potential effects of program trading. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here by the fact that the resistance (the first sentence) is contingent upon the level of concern (the second sentence). In other words, the resistance would occur because of the concern.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||But regulators are wary .||They have n't forgotten the leap in share prices last Dec. 7 , .||The first sentence indicates that regulators are cautious or hesitant. The second sentence provides a reason for their wariness: they remember a significant increase in share prices on a specific date (Dec. 7). The regulators' current state of wariness is contingent upon their recollection of past events, specifically the leap in share prices. This connection shows that their cautious behavior is a result of what happened previously, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing||Japan 's Finance Ministry had set up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time .||The first sentence indicates there was a belief that enough rules were written to prevent extreme market swings. The second sentence details specific actions taken by Japan's Finance Ministry to limit market fluctuations and manage trading, including setting up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall and giving market operators authority to suspend trading. These details expand on the initial statement by providing examples of the rules and mechanisms put in place to prevent such swings, thus explaining and supporting the belief mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Tokyo 's leading program traders are the big U.S. securities houses , .||Some U.S. firms , notably Salomon Inc. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc. , have reaped a hefty chunk of their Japanese earnings from index arbitrage , both for customers and for their own accounts .||The first sentence states that Tokyo's leading program traders are the large U.S. securities houses. The second sentence provides specific examples of these U.S. firms, namely Salomon Inc. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc., and explains how they have earned a significant portion of their Japanese profits through index arbitrage. This additional information expands upon the initial statement by giving concrete examples and further details about the success of these U.S. securities houses in Tokyo.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||Both Deryck C. Maughan , who heads Salomon in Tokyo , and John S. Wadsworth , who heads Morgan Stanley there , ascribe a good part of their firms ' success in Tokyo to their ability to offer sophisticated , futures-related investment strategies to big institutional clients .||They do n't have plans to cut back .||The first sentence explains the perspective of Deryck C. Maughan and John S. Wadsworth on their firms' success in Tokyo, attributing it to their ability to provide advanced investment strategies to large clients. The second sentence states that they do not intend to reduce these efforts. This suggests a continuation or maintenance of the current strategy, expanding on the idea that they believe in the effectiveness of their approach and plan to continue with it, hence the expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||It has not been disruptive in the markets here||that the cash market here ... is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market is n't having the same impact it does in America||The first sentence states that something has not been disruptive in the local markets. The second sentence explains why this is the case: the cash market is sufficiently large and liquid, which means the futures market does not have the same impact as it does in America. The reason provided in the second sentence (the size and liquidity of the cash market) explains the lack of disruption mentioned in the first sentence, establishing a contingent relationship. The situation in the markets (lack of disruption) depends on the condition described (the size and liquidity of the cash market).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The British also are scrutinizing program trades .||Index-arbitrage trading is `` something we want to watch closely||The first sentence states that the British are scrutinizing program trades. The second sentence specifies one type of program trade, index-arbitrage trading, that they are watching closely. The second sentence expands on the first by providing more detail about what kind of program trades are being watched. Therefore, the relationship is one of expansion, where additional information is given to clarify or further explain the initial statement.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'although'] ||Index-arbitrage trading is `` something we want to watch closely||`` We do n't think there is cause for concern at the moment . ''||In the first sentence, the speaker expresses a desire to closely monitor index-arbitrage trading, suggesting a level of caution or interest.In the second sentence, the speaker states that they do not believe there is a reason for concern currently. These two sentences are in comparison because they present two different perspectives or attitudes toward the same subject (index-arbitrage trading). While the first sentence indicates vigilance, the second reassures that there is no immediate cause for alarm, comparing the level of concern and the need for monitoring.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||London serves increasingly as a conduit for program trading of U.S. stocks .||London has several attractions||The first sentence states that London is increasingly being used as a channel for program trading in U.S. stocks. The second sentence mentions that London has several attractions. Given the relationship of contingency, it suggests that the use of London for program trading is connected to its inherent attractions. Therefore, the fact that London is being used more for program trading of U.S. stocks is contingent upon or influenced by its various attractive features, likely including its financial infrastructure and market regulations.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'first'] ||Britain has two main index-arbitrage instruments .||A Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index option contract is traded on the London Stock Exchange 's Traded Options Market .||The first sentence states that Britain has two main index-arbitrage instruments. The second sentence provides specific information about one of those instruments: the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index option contract, including where it is traded (on the London Stock Exchange's Traded Options Market). This detail expands upon the initial statement about the existence of index-arbitrage instruments in Britain by giving concrete details about one of them. Therefore, the relationship is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||The average number of FT-SE option contracts traded on the London exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract 's launch in 1984 .||This year , the average of daily contracts traded totaled 9,118 , up from 4,645 a year earlier and from 917 in 1984 .||The first sentence states that the average number of FT-SE option contracts traded on the London exchange has increased nearly tenfold since 1984. The second sentence provides specific numbers to support this claim, showing the increase in average daily contracts traded from 1984 to the current year. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by offering detailed data that substantiates the surge mentioned in the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor .||Advocates said the 90-cent-an-hour rise , to $ 4.25 an hour by April 1991 , is too small for the working poor , .||The first sentence outlines that there was a debate filled with complaints from both sides about a significant wage increase. The second sentence details one part of the debate, specifying the position of the advocates who complained that the 90-cent raise to $4.25 an hour was insufficient for the working poor. Thus, the second sentence expands on the content of the debate mentioned in the first sentence by providing specific details about the advocates' viewpoint.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||So both sides accepted the compromise , which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in 1977 , raising the wage to $ 3.35 an hour from $ 2.65 .||Under the measure passed yesterday , the minimum wage would rise to $ 3.80 next April .||The first sentence outlines that a compromise was accepted, leading to the first increase in the minimum wage since 1977, with the wage going up to $3.35 from $2.65. The second sentence provides more specific details about the increase: under the new measure, the minimum wage will rise to $3.80 the following April. The second sentence expands on the information provided in the first sentence by giving more precise details about the wage increase.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||the House 's acceptance of a new youth `` training '' wage ,||Adopting a training-wage policy means `` getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage||The first sentence states that the House accepted a new youth "training" wage. The second sentence discusses what adopting such a training-wage policy means: moving past the small adjustments typically associated with minimum wage. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the meaning or implication of the second sentence (getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage) depends on the context provided in the first sentence (the House's acceptance of the new youth training wage). The adoption of the new policy is contingent upon the House's decision, suggesting that the move to a more substantial approach to wages is a consequence of accepting the new training wage.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||For six years , T. Marshall Hahn Jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the George Bush mode : kind and gentle .||The question now : Can he act more like hard-charging Teddy Roosevelt ?||The first sentence outlines how T. Marshall Hahn Jr. has conducted corporate acquisitions in a specific manner (kind and gentle).The second sentence poses a question about whether he can change his approach to be more aggressive (like Teddy Roosevelt).This relationship is contingent because the question directly relates to and depends on the established method of acquisitions by T. Marshall Hahn Jr. The query arises from his previous behavior, suggesting a contingency between the description of his past actions and the questioning of his potential for change.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Mr. Hahn , the 62-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of Georgia-Pacific Corp. is leading the forest-product concern 's unsolicited $ 3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp .||Nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder , a reaction Mr. Hahn has n't faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions , all of which were negotiated behind the scenes .||The first sentence introduces Mr. Hahn's role and the unsolicited bid he is leading for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.The second sentence compares Nekoosa's public rejection of the offer to Mr. Hahn's previous experiences with acquisitions, noting that he hasn't faced such a reaction before. This establishes a comparison between the current situation and his past acquisitions, highlighting the difference in responses. The relationship is comparative because it contrasts the present scenario with Mr. Hahn's prior experiences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||while talking tough||`` We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction , '' he says .||The first part of the sentence describes the subject's tone: "talking tough." The second part of the sentence provides more detail about what the subject means by "talking tough" through a direct quote: "We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction," he says. The quote expands on the meaning of "talking tough" by specifying the aggressive pursuit of completing a transaction. Therefore, the relationship between the two parts of the sentence is one of expansion, where the latter part elaborates on the meaning of the former.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||`` There 's a price above which I 'm positive Marshall has the courage not to pay , '' says A.D. Correll , Georgia-Pacific 's executive vice president for pulp and paper .||Says long-time associate Jerry Griffin , vice president , corporate development , at WTD Industries Inc. : `` He is n't of the old school of winning at any cost . ''||In the first sentence, A.D. Correll states that there is a certain price point beyond which Marshall would refuse to pay, suggesting that Marshall has the courage to set limits on spending. In the second sentence, another individual, Jerry Griffin, provides additional information about Marshall's approach, saying that he isn't from the "old school" of winning at any cost, implying that he is more cautious with spending and decision-making. The relationship here is one of expansion, as Jerry Griffin’s comment provides further context and elaboration on the idea presented by A.D. Correll. Both statements highlight Marshall’s financial prudence and willingness to set boundaries, reinforcing each other through different perspectives.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute||Assuming that post at the age of 35 , he managed by consensus , as is the rule in universities||The first sentence states that Mr. Hahn adopted a careful management style when he became the president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute. The second sentence expands on this idea by providing additional information about his age when he assumed the position (35 years old) and how he managed by consensus, which is typical for universities. This further explains the nature of his careful approach to management, hence forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand .||In 1970 , Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building .||The first sentence states that Mr. Hahn demonstrated a willingness to take a strong stand. The second sentence provides a specific instance of when Mr. Hahn took a strong stand: in 1970, when he called in state police to arrest student protesters. This instance serves to expand or provide evidence for the claim made in the first sentence, thereby illustrating Mr. Hahn's willingness to take decisive action. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by offering a concrete example of Mr. Hahn's assertive behavior.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||That impressed Robert B. Pamplin , Georgia-Pacific 's chief executive at the time , whom Mr. Hahn had met while fundraising for the institute .||In 1975 , Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals ; .||The first sentence indicates that Mr. Hahn made a favorable impression on Robert B. Pamplin, who was Georgia-Pacific's chief executive at the time. The second sentence tells us that, in 1975, Mr. Pamplin offered Mr. Hahn a position at the company. The contingency relationship is evident because Mr. Pamplin's decision to invite Mr. Hahn to join Georgia-Pacific (the second event) was contingent upon Mr. Hahn having previously impressed Mr. Pamplin (the first event). The offer of employment was a direct result of the earlier positive impression.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'although'] ||In 1975 , Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals ; .||the move befuddled many in Georgia-Pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world||The first sentence states that Mr. Pamplin convinced Mr. Hahn to join the company as an executive vice president in 1975. The second sentence describes the reaction from people within Georgia-Pacific, noting their skepticism about Mr. Hahn's ability to transition from a university administrator to the corporate world. The comparison relationship is established through the contrast between Mr. Hahn's new role at the company and the doubts of those within Georgia-Pacific about his suitability for the position due to his previous experience.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||But Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks , demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on .||, Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates .||The first sentence states that Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks due to his raw intelligence, which he knew he had from an early age. The second sentence provides specific evidence of this early intelligence by mentioning that Mr. Hahn skipped first grade due to his advanced reading skills. This detail expands upon the claim that Mr. Hahn recognized his intelligence early on, supporting the assertion with an example of his academic prowess at a young age. Thus, the second sentence expands the information provided in the first one by giving a concrete instance of his early intellectual abilities.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||, Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates .||Moving rapidly through school , he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky at age 18 , .||The first sentence states that Mr. Hahn skipped the first grade due to his advanced reading skills compared to his peers. The second sentence expands on his academic journey, mentioning that he moved rapidly through school and graduated from the University of Kentucky with honors at a young age. This further elaboration on his educational achievements illustrates the broader context of his academic success, which began with skipping the first grade. The second sentence adds detail and continuation to the initial information, hence the expansion relationship.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||Moving rapidly through school , he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky at age 18 , after spending only 2 1/2 years in college .||He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .||The first sentence states that the individual graduated from the University of Kentucky at an unusually young age, after a very short period of study. The second sentence mentions that he later earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from MIT. The temporal relationship is evident because earning a doctorate typically occurs after completing one's undergraduate degree. Thus, the sequence of events is: graduating from university at age 18, then obtaining a doctorate at a later point in time.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||but friends say that 's an understatement .||They call it `` photographic '' .||The first sentence indicates that the subject's friends believe something is an understatement, suggesting they think it's described less strongly than necessary. The second sentence reveals what the friends call it: "photographic." This provides additional detail or elaboration on their opinion, explaining how they would more accurately describe the situation. Thus, the second sentence expands upon the idea introduced in the first sentence by offering a specific term ("photographic") that the friends use to describe the subject.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Mr. Hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of Georgia-Pacific .||Taking over as chief executive officer in 1983 , he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession-inspired slide in its building-products business . Mr. Hahn began selling non-core businesses , such as oil and gas and chemicals . He even sold one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers . At the same time , he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling , rather than materials for new-home construction . The idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new-home construction . The formula has paid off , so far . Georgia-Pacific 's sales climbed to $ 9.5 billion last year , compared with $ 6 billion in 1983 , when Mr. Hahn took the reins . Profit from continuing operations has soared to $ 467 million from $ 75 million .||The first sentence states that Mr. Hahn has engineered a surprising turnaround at Georgia-Pacific. The subsequent text provides details about how this turnaround was achieved: by selling non-core businesses, focusing on specific segments like pulp and paper and building products for home repair and remodeling, and improving financial results. This additional information expands upon the initial statement, explaining the steps taken and the outcomes achieved under Mr. Hahn's leadership. Thus, the relationship between the sentences is expansion, as the later text elaborates on the turnaround mentioned in the first sentence.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||Taking over as chief executive officer in 1983 , he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession-inspired slide in its building-products business .||Mr. Hahn began selling non-core businesses , such as oil and gas and chemicals .||The first sentence states that when he became CEO in 1983, he found the company in a difficult financial situation.The second sentence explains actions taken by Mr. Hahn to address this situation, specifically selling non-core businesses. The temporal relationship is demonstrated by the sequence of events: Mr. Hahn became CEO and then took steps to improve the company's financial health. The second sentence describes actions taken after the situation described in the first sentence, establishing a temporal relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Mr. Hahn began selling non-core businesses , such as oil and gas and chemicals .||He even sold one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers .||The first sentence states that Mr. Hahn started selling non-core businesses, including specific sectors like oil and gas and chemicals. The second sentence provides a more detailed example of what was sold: a unit that produced vinyl checkbook covers. This detail expands on the initial statement by giving a specific instance of the type of business Mr. Hahn was selling, thus providing more concrete information about the non-core businesses mentioned earlier. Therefore, the second sentence serves as an expansion of the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The formula has paid off , so far .||Georgia-Pacific 's sales climbed to $ 9.5 billion last year , compared with $ 6 billion in 1983 , when Mr. Hahn took the reins .||The first sentence indicates that a certain strategy or approach ("the formula") has been successful up to this point. The second sentence provides specific evidence of success through the growth in sales at Georgia-Pacific from $6 billion in 1983 to $9.5 billion last year. This growth directly supports the claim that "the formula has paid off," expanding upon the initial statement by offering quantitative data (sales figures) that demonstrates the success. Thus, the relationship between the sentences is one of expansion, where the latter provides additional supportive details for the former.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Georgia-Pacific 's sales climbed to $ 9.5 billion last year , compared with $ 6 billion in 1983 , when Mr. Hahn took the reins .||Profit from continuing operations has soared to $ 467 million from $ 75 million .||The first sentence states that Georgia-Pacific's sales increased significantly, reaching $9.5 billion last year from $6 billion in 1983, the year Mr. Hahn became CEO. The second sentence discusses the rise in profit from continuing operations, from $75 million to $467 million. The expansion relationship is established because the second sentence provides additional information about the growth of the company under Mr. Hahn's leadership, specifically focusing on profit growth, which complements the information about sales growth in the first sentence. Both pieces of evidence show the overall improvement and growth of the company over the period.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Nekoosa would n't be a diversification .||It would be a good match of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows .||The first sentence states that Nekoosa wouldn't represent diversification for the company.In the second sentence, it is mentioned that Nekoosa would be a good match, describing positive attributes of the combination (two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows).These sentences present a comparison by contrasting the idea of Nekoosa not being a diversification with it being a good match based on shared qualities. This contrast helps to highlight the nature of the acquisition as complementary rather than diversifying, establishing a comparative relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||It would be a good match of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows .||The resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $ 13 billion .||The first sentence describes the qualities of the companies involved in a potential merger, stating they are healthy with high-quality assets and strong cash flows. The second sentence then expands on the implications of such a merger, indicating that the combined entity would become the largest forest-products company globally with significant sales figures. The expansion is evident as the second sentence builds upon the initial description by providing additional details about the scale and impact of the merger.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||In this instance he is entering uncharted waters .||This is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced||The first sentence states that "he" is entering uncharted waters, suggesting a new and unfamiliar situation. The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying the nature of the challenge: it is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced. The second sentence provides additional information that clarifies and elaborates on the initial statement, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The action on Poland came as the conference separately approved $ 220 million for international population planning activities , an 11 % increase over fiscal 1989 .||The House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations , but the size of the increase is itself significant .||The first sentence introduces the approval of $220 million for international population planning activities, with an 11% increase over fiscal 1989. The second sentence expands on this information by discussing the division in the House and Senate regarding the allocation of funds to the United Nations Population Fund. While this introduces a new detail, the focus remains on the significance of the increase in funding, thus expanding on the initial point about the funding increase.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||House Majority Whip William Gray D. , Pa . began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English-speaking countries of the Caribbean , such as Jamaica and Barbados||Rep. Jerry Lewis , a conservative Californian , added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia||The first sentence introduces a proposal made by House Majority Whip William Gray regarding the allocation of a quota to English-speaking countries in the Caribbean. The second sentence expands on the context by mentioning another representative, Rep. Jerry Lewis, who adds a provision aimed at assisting Bolivia. This additional information broadens the scope of the discussion from Gray's initial proposal to include another representative's contribution to the same topic. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where more details or related actions are added to the original subject.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||Rep. Jerry Lewis , a conservative Californian , added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia , and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines - backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye .||Jamaica , wary of upsetting its Caribbean Basin allies , has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by Mr. Gray , but the greater question is whether Mr. Inouye , who has strong ties to the sugar industry , is able to insert a claim by the Philippines .||The first sentence outlines actions taken by Rep. Jerry Lewis and the Senate to expand aid to various countries, with specific mention of Sen. Daniel Inouye's involvement in supporting the inclusion of the Philippines. The second sentence introduces Jamaica's response to these actions, specifically mentioning its decision regarding a provision drafted by Mr. Gray and raises a question about Sen. Inouye's potential influence. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through Jamaica's reaction to the initial actions taken by Rep. Lewis and the Senate, particularly concerning Sen. Inouye's efforts for the Philippines. Jamaica's instruction to its lobbyist is contingent upon the broader actions taken by others, and the uncertainty surrounding Sen. Inouye's influence further connects the two sentences in a contingent manner.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||In separate floor action , the House waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $ 3.18 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal 1990 .||The funding is attached to an estimated $ 27.1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the Senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all U.S. domestic airline flights .||The first sentence discusses the House's approval of $3.18 billion in supplemental appropriations for specific programs. The second sentence introduces another piece of legislation, a $27.1 billion transportation bill, which includes other provisions like a smoking ban. The comparison relationship is not immediately apparent in the context provided. Typically, a comparison would involve contrasting or comparing attributes of two entities. Given the content, it seems there might be a contextual misunderstanding. However, if we were to identify a comparative element, it could relate to the size or nature of the bills or the processes involved. For instance, one might compare the amounts ($3.18 billion vs. $27.1 billion) or the processes through which they move. But based on the provided information, the relationship does not clearly demonstrate a direct comparison between the two bills.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||`` The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view , '' says Jack White , a planner with the Indiana Highway Department .||He and others prefer to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a four-foot-high concrete slab with no openings .||In the first sentence, Jack White, a planner with the Indiana Highway Department, explains the primary function of a railing: to contain a vehicle rather than provide a scenic view. The second sentence then describes a preference for installing specific types of railings, like the "type F safety shape," which is a four-foot-high concrete slab without any openings. This preference is contingent upon the rationale provided in the first sentence. In other words, because the primary purpose of a railing is containment, there is a preference for railings designed specifically for safety over those that might offer better views.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||In Richmond , Ind. , the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge .||Garret Boone , who teaches art at Earlham College , calls the new structure `` just an ugly bridge '' and one that blocks the view of a new park below .||The first sentence describes the use of type F railing for replacing arched openings on the G Street Bridge in Richmond, Ind. The second sentence presents Garret Boone's opinion about the new structure, referring to it as "just an ugly bridge" and noting that it obstructs the view of a new park below. The comparison relationship is established through the contrast between the factual description of the bridge's construction and the critical opinion provided by Garret Boone. Boone's negative assessment of the bridge's aesthetics and impact on the surrounding environment serves as a comparative viewpoint to the neutral statement about the bridge's construction, highlighting a difference in perspective between the physical reality of the bridge and its perceived aesthetic value.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Compromises are possible .||Citizens in Peninsula , Ohio , upset over changes to a bridge , negotiated a deal : The bottom half of the railing will be type F , while the top half will have the old bridge 's floral pattern .||The first sentence makes a general statement suggesting that compromises can be reached.In the second sentence, we see a specific example of a compromise: citizens in Peninsula, Ohio, who were unhappy with changes to a bridge, negotiated a solution involving a combination of new and old design elements for the bridge railing.This detailed example illustrates the concept of compromise mentioned in the first sentence, providing a concrete instance of what a compromise looks like in practice. Therefore, the second sentence expands upon the idea introduced in the first sentence, demonstrating how compromises are indeed possible.

The second sentence provides specific details about what that deal entails: the design of the bridge railing. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more information about the content of the deal that was mentioned.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Inventor Claire Marvin says his design virtually eliminates spilling .||Lids are n't even needed .||The first sentence states that inventor Claire Marvin claims his design significantly reduces spilling.The second sentence further elaborates on the effectiveness of the design by stating that lids aren't even needed.This indicates that the design is so effective at preventing spills that additional measures, like using lids, become unnecessary. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by providing more detail about how effective the design is.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Lids are n't even needed .||the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers||The first sentence suggests that lids are unnecessary for some unspecified context. The second sentence provides additional information about a carrier, explaining that it costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers. This additional detail expands on the idea presented in the first sentence by suggesting a specific context (a carrier without lids) where lids are indeed not needed. Thus, the second sentence expands on the concept introduced in the first one, providing more detail about a situation where lids are not required.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The company acknowledges some problems .||A driver has to find something to hang the carrier on , so the company supplies a window hook .||The first sentence indicates there are some unspecified problems acknowledged by the company. The second sentence details one specific problem and its solution: drivers need a way to hang the carrier, so the company provides a window hook. This second sentence expands on the initial acknowledgment of problems by providing a concrete example of one such problem and how the company addresses it.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||A driver has to find something to hang the carrier on , so the company supplies a window hook .||While it breaks down in prolonged sunlight , it is n't recyclable .||The first sentence states that the company supplies a window hook for hanging the carrier. The second sentence provides additional information about the window hook: it breaks down in prolonged sunlight and isn't recyclable.

Specifically, the second sentence adds information about the durability and recyclability of the window hook, giving more context about the product mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Dan Droz , leader of the Carnegie-Mellon group , sees benefits all around .||The Soviets , , will get `` exposure to a market system Americans will learn more about making products for the Soviets .||The first sentence states that Dan Droz, who leads the Carnegie-Mellon group, foresees benefits for everyone involved. The second sentence elaborates on what those benefits are: the Soviets gaining exposure to a market system and Americans learning more about creating products for the Soviet market. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by providing specific details about the benefits mentioned.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The Soviets , who normally have few clients other than the state , will get `` exposure to a market system||Americans will learn more about making products for the Soviets .||The first sentence discusses the Soviets' limited experience with market systems due to their reliance on the state. The second sentence mentions what Americans can learn from creating products for the Soviets. The comparison relationship here is implied through the mutual exchange of experiences and knowledge: while the Soviets will gain exposure to a market system, Americans will learn about producing goods for Soviet consumers. Both groups stand to gain new insights and experiences, creating a parallel comparison.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'since'] ||the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose||In Moscow , they kept asking us things like , ` Why do you make 15 different corkscrews , when all you need is one good one ? '||The first sentence indicates that the Soviets have the potential to influence or assist U.S. designers in renewing their sense of purpose. The second sentence provides a specific example of how this influence might manifest: through questions posed by the Soviets about design choices (such as the variety of corkscrews). The example in the second sentence supports the idea that interaction with Soviet perspectives could indeed help U.S. designers reconsider their approach, thus renewing their sense of purpose. Therefore, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, as it offers a practical scenario illustrating the potential impact described in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||In Moscow , they kept asking us things like , ` Why do you make 15 different corkscrews , when all you need is one good one ? '||`` They got us thinking maybe we should be helping U.S. companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones . ''||The first sentence describes the Russians questioning the variety of products (specifically corkscrews) from the U.S., suggesting a focus on quality over quantity. The second sentence shows a shift in thinking as a result of these interactions, indicating that the speaker started considering helping U.S. companies improve their existing products instead of always developing new ones. The change in perspective (helping to improve existing products) is contingent upon the experience of being asked critical questions by the Russians.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Eggers Group architects propose using grain elevators to house prisoners||It would ease jail overcrowding while preserving historic structures||The first sentence introduces a proposal by the Eggers Group architects to repurpose grain elevators for housing prisoners. The second sentence presents a potential benefit or rationale for this proposal: it could help alleviate jail overcrowding and preserve historical buildings. The relationship is contingent because the second sentence explains a possible reason or motivation behind the architects' proposal, indicating that the suggested use of grain elevators is contingent on addressing the issue of jail overcrowding and the desire to maintain historic structures.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Grain elevators built in the 1920s and '30s have six-inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle||Many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster , yet close enough to permit family visits .||The first sentence describes the structural features of grain elevators built in the 1920s and '30s, including their construction materials and shape that can accommodate specific designs. The second sentence provides additional information about the location of these structures, explaining how they are situated in relation to residential areas, which allows for both public acceptance and accessibility for family visits. This additional detail expands on the context of the first sentence by providing information about the practical considerations of their placement, hence the expansion relationship.

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972||USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years , `` yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards||The first sentence provides information about worker fatalities at the two plants over a certain period: three in the past two years and 17 since 1972. The second sentence expands on the context of these fatalities by indicating that USX managers were aware of safety and health issues at the plants for years but did not take sufficient action. This additional information broadens the understanding of the situation by explaining the knowledge and inaction of the management, contributing to the context of the worker fatalities. Thus, the second sentence expands the context of the first sentence by providing more detail about the circumstances surrounding the worker deaths.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||`` Once we do , they will receive very serious evaluation , ''||`` No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees . ''||The first sentence indicates that there will be a serious evaluation once a certain unspecified condition is met.The second sentence emphasizes the priority of employee health and safety over all other considerations. The contingency relationship is established because the serious evaluation mentioned in the first sentence is likely to be triggered by concerns related to health and safety, suggesting that the evaluation is contingent upon issues pertaining to the well-being of the employees.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||it has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began investigating the Clairton and Fairless works||that , if and when safety problems were identified , they were corrected||The first sentence states that the company has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began investigating the Clairton and Fairless works. The second sentence explains the nature of this cooperation: any safety problems identified during the investigations were corrected. This second sentence expands on the nature of the cooperation mentioned in the first sentence, specifying what form the cooperation took. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Your Oct. 6 editorial `` The Ill Homeless '' referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the Sept. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .||Your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause '' of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population .||The first sentence states that the Oct. 6 editorial "The Ill Homeless" referenced research conducted by the authors and their colleagues, published in the Sept. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The second sentence explains what the comments in the editorial implied about the findings of the research - specifically, that the primary cause of homelessness is the prevalence of mental illness and substance abuse within the homeless population. The second sentence expands on the first by providing more detail about the implications of the research mentioned in the editorial. It clarifies the specific aspect of the research that the editorial focused on, thus deepening the reader's understanding of the content and context of the reference.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause '' of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population .||We have made no such statement .||The first sentence states that the listener's comments suggested they believed the speaker had identified the "principal cause" of homelessness as being related to mental illness and substance abuse in the homeless population. The second sentence directly contradicts this suggestion, stating that no such statement has been made by the speaker. The comparison relationship is evident because the second sentence is comparing the listener's interpretation (implied in their comments) with what the speaker actually said, highlighting a difference between the two.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||We have made no such statement .||It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless .||The first sentence states that "We have made no such statement," implying that there is a specific statement being referred to that the speaker or group has not made. The second sentence provides information about a topic ("most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless") which could potentially be the subject of the unspecified statement mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more detail about what kind of statement has not been made, thus providing additional context and elaborating on the original point. This establishes the Expansion relationship, where the second sentence adds information to the first without directly contradicting or supporting it.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless .||The `` causes '' of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case .||The first sentence states that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless. This implies that while mental illness and alcoholism may contribute to homelessness, they are not the sole determinants. The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining that the causes of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case. This suggests that there are many factors at play beyond just mental illness and alcoholism.In summary, the second sentence expands upon the first by providing additional context about the complexity of homelessness and clarifying that its causes are not well-understood, which further supports the notion that mental illness and alcoholism alone do not typically lead to homelessness.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||In quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism .||You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .||The first sentence states that the speaker noted the emphasis on the high prevalence of mental illness and alcoholism in the research about the homeless population. The second sentence points out that the speaker did not mention the presence of multiple physical disorders in the same population. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting what was emphasized (mental illness and alcoholism) with what was not mentioned (physical disorders). This contrast highlights the difference in the focus of the discussion, indicating a comparison between the aspects covered and those omitted.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse||They suffered from malnutrition , chest diseases , cardiovascular disorders , skin problems , infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape .||The first sentence states that the homeless individuals examined had multiple physical disorders along with psychiatric issues and substance abuse. The second sentence lists specific examples of the physical disorders mentioned in the first sentence (malnutrition, chest diseases, etc.). This list provides more detailed information about what is meant by "a multitude of physical disorders." Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving concrete examples of the disorders mentioned, illustrating the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||They suffered from malnutrition , chest diseases , cardiovascular disorders , skin problems , infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape .||Homeless people not only lack safety , privacy and shelter , they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition , cleanliness and basic health care .||The first sentence lists specific health issues experienced by a group, implied to be homeless people based on the context provided in the second sentence. The second sentence generalizes the conditions of homeless people, mentioning the lack of safety, privacy, shelter, nutrition, cleanliness, and basic healthcare. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence broadens the context of the first sentence by explaining the broader living conditions and lack of essentials that lead to the specific health issues mentioned earlier. It gives a more comprehensive understanding of the situation faced by homeless individuals.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter||The interactions between health and homelessness are complex , defying sweeping generalizations as to `` cause '' or `` effect . ''||The first sentence outlines the various ways health issues and homelessness can intersect, suggesting a complex relationship where health problems can both lead to homelessness and result from it, and some conditions are hard to treat without stable housing. The second sentence emphasizes the complexity of the relationship and warns against making broad statements about cause and effect. The contingency relationship is evident because the warning in the second sentence is based on the complex scenarios described in the first sentence. Understanding the nuanced relationship between health and homelessness (as outlined in the first sentence) leads to the cautionary note about avoiding oversimplification (as stated in the second sentence).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||homelessness is due to a complex array of problems , with the common thread of poverty||that nearly 40 % of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25 % of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug , alcohol and mental problems||The first sentence outlines the general cause of homelessness - a complex array of problems with poverty being the common thread. The second sentence provides specific details about the composition of the homeless population (nearly 40% are women and children) and the percentage experiencing drug, alcohol, and mental health issues (only 25%). These specifics expand upon the initial statement by giving concrete examples of the complex array of problems contributing to homelessness. Therefore, the second sentence expands the information given in the first sentence, providing more detail about the nature of the problem.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||If you 're homeless , you do n't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered||After your first three weeks of sleep deprivation , you 're scarcely in touch with reality any more||The first sentence describes the consequence of homelessness, specifically the inability to sleep due to fear. The second sentence quantifies the impact of sleep deprivation over time, stating the mental state after three weeks without proper sleep. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the initial state of fear due to homelessness with the resulting mental state after prolonged sleep deprivation, illustrating the severity of the issue by comparing the emotional state at the start (fear) to the mental state after three weeks (losing touch with reality).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||After your first three weeks of sleep deprivation , you 're scarcely in touch with reality any more||without psychiatric treatment , you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again||The first sentence states the consequence of three weeks of sleep deprivation: being scarcely in touch with reality.The second sentence further elaborates on the potential long-term effects of untreated sleep deprivation: being unable to fend for oneself ever again without psychiatric treatment. The second sentence expands on the severity of the consequences of sleep deprivation, indicating that the issues could become permanent without intervention. This expansion of consequences from detachment from reality to potential permanent incapacity to care for oneself establishes the expansion relationship.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim , brutal world of our city streets .||Once there , what ways of escape are open to them other than drink , drugs or insanity ?||The first sentence describes a situation where many people have ended up in a difficult living condition on the city streets due to economic issues. The second sentence then poses a question about the limited options for escape available to those individuals once they are on the streets.The temporal relationship is implied by the sequence of events: first, people fall through cracks in the economy and end up on the streets, and subsequently, the question about their options for escape arises. The second sentence follows the first in a sequence that suggests a progression of thoughts or events over time.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic : namely , that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness .||Your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made .||The first sentence points out the absence of consideration for the inverse of the logic presented, suggesting that mental illness and substance abuse could be results of homelessness instead of its causes. The second sentence adds context by stating that the research ended once a convenient claim was found. This further explains the lack of exploration into alternative viewpoints, including the inverse logic. Thus, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first by providing more detail on the extent of the oversight - the cessation of research upon finding a convenient assertion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||But is n't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to , and advertise in , your paper ?||Why did n't you mention the YMCA or the YWCA or Catholic Charities USA or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march ?||The first sentence questions the driving force behind those who support the paper through subscriptions and advertisements, suggesting it might be the desire for profit. The second sentence expands on the idea of motivations or interests by questioning the omission of non-profit organizations that participated in a march. Both sentences explore the theme of motivations or interests, but the second sentence broadens the discussion from personal or commercial interests (profit) to include non-profit motivations, hence establishing an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||As for the findings on the 203 Baltimore homeless who underwent psychiatric examinations , I suggest you conduct your own survey .||Choose 203 business executives , including , perhaps , someone from your own staff , and put them out on the streets , to be deprived for one month of their homes , families and income .||The first sentence proposes a suggestion to conduct a survey related to the psychiatric examination findings of 203 homeless individuals in Baltimore. The second sentence expands upon this idea by providing a specific way to conduct the survey: choosing 203 business executives (including possibly someone from the addressee's staff) and having them experience homelessness for a month. This detailed method is an expansion of the initial suggestion, offering a concrete approach to carrying out the proposed survey.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||Choose 203 business executives , including , perhaps , someone from your own staff , and put them out on the streets , to be deprived for one month of their homes , families and income .||that within a short time most of them would find Thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal and that their `` normal '' phobias , anxieties , depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically||The first sentence outlines an action: choosing 203 business executives and placing them in a deprived situation for one month. The second sentence predicts the outcome of this action: over time, these executives would adapt to their new circumstances and experience increased mental health issues and substance abuse. The temporal relationship is established through the sequence of events: the action taken in the first sentence occurs before the predicted outcomes in the second sentence. The passage of time leads from the initial action to the eventual changes in the executives' behavior and well-being.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||the shares will be convertible into Class B shares , but that the company has the option to redeem the shares before a conversion takes place||the coupon rate has n't yet been fixed , but will probably be set at around 8 %||The first sentence outlines the basic terms regarding the convertibility of certain shares and the company's option to redeem them. The second sentence provides additional information about the unspecified details from the first sentence, specifically mentioning the likely coupon rate. This additional detail expands upon the initial description of the shares' terms, hence the relationship is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The final vote came after the House rejected Republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor .||The Bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry||The first sentence discusses the legislative process where the House rejected Republican efforts to weaken a bill and approved amendments favored by organized labor. The second sentence expands on the context by explaining the Bush administration's stance on the bill, specifically mentioning its threat to veto due to concerns over intrusion into industry affairs. This additional information deepens our understanding of the political landscape surrounding the bill, thus forming an expansionary relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The broader question is where the Senate stands on the issue .||While the Senate Commerce Committee has approved legislation similar to the House bill on airline leveraged buy-outs , the measure has n't yet come to the full floor .||The first sentence raises a broader question about the Senate's stance on an unspecified issue. The second sentence provides context for this question by detailing a specific legislative action taken by the Senate Commerce Committee, which approved legislation, but it hasn't been brought to the full Senate floor. This implies that the uncertainty about the Senate's position (as mentioned in the first sentence) may be due to the fact that the full Senate has not yet voted on the legislation. Therefore, the second sentence explains a contributing factor to the broader question posed in the first sentence, indicating a contingent relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||, it is aimed at giving the Transportation Department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt .||The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier 's ability to compete||The first sentence states the aim of a certain measure: to give the Transportation Department the opportunity to review transactions involving significant debt in advance. The second sentence expands on this aim by specifying the context for this review: to prevent airline acquisitions that could burden a carrier with too much debt, potentially compromising safety or competitive capability. Thus, the second sentence provides additional detail and elaboration on the purpose outlined in the first sentence, establishing an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||The bill , , would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15 % or more of the stock in an airline .||The department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired ; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished ; it would be put into foreign control ; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit .||The first sentence introduces a bill that allows the Transportation Department to review purchases of 15% or more of the stock in an airline. The second sentence details specific conditions under which the department would be required to block a buyout. These conditions elaborate on the scope of the department's authority and the criteria for intervention, providing additional information about when and how the department's review power can be exercised. This detailed elaboration establishes an expansion relationship between the two sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Alternative', 'or'] ||The department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired ; ; .||its ability to compete would be sharply diminished||The first sentence states that the department must block the buy-out if the acquisition could financially weaken a carrier to the point where safety is compromised. The second sentence adds another condition under which the department would also block the buy-out: if the carrier's ability to compete is significantly reduced. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the conditions for blocking the buy-out, providing additional detail about when such an action would be taken.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Alternative', 'or'] ||its ability to compete would be sharply diminished||it would be put into foreign control||The first sentence states that the entity's ability to compete would be significantly reduced. The second sentence provides additional context by specifying that this reduction in competitiveness would occur as a result of being placed under foreign control. The second sentence expands upon the first by explaining a specific scenario (foreign control) that would lead to the diminished competitive ability mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||You now may drop by the Voice of America offices in Washington and read the text of what the Voice is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week .||You can even take notes -- extensive notes , for the Voice folks wo n't look over your shoulder -- about what you read .||The first sentence states that one can visit the Voice of America offices in Washington and read the text of their broadcasts. The second sentence elaborates on this by specifying that visitors can take extensive notes without being monitored. This further clarifies the level of access and freedom provided to visitors at the Voice of America offices, expanding on the initial statement about being able to read the broadcast texts.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||You can even take notes -- extensive notes , for the Voice folks wo n't look over your shoulder -- about what you read .||You can do all this even if you 're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress .||The first sentence indicates that one has the freedom to take extensive notes without being watched by the Voice folks.The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying that anyone can enjoy this freedom, regardless of their profession or status, such as not being a reporter, a researcher, a scholar, or a member of Congress. It broadens the scope of who can benefit from the situation described in the first sentence, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||It was censorship .||It was outrageous .||The first sentence identifies the situation as "censorship." The second sentence characterizes the same situation as "outrageous." The second sentence expands on the first by providing an opinion or emotional response to the act of censorship. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence adds more descriptive detail (that the censorship was outrageous) to the initial statement about the nature of the act.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'but'] ||The theory was that the Voice is a propaganda agency and this government should n't propagandize its own people .||That sounds neat , but this government -- -- propagandizes its own people every day .||The first sentence presents the theory that the Voice is considered a propaganda agency and that the government shouldn't propagandize its own citizens. The second sentence challenges this notion by stating that the government does indeed propagandize its own people daily. The comparison is drawn between the theory's stance against government propaganda and the reality of the government's daily actions, highlighting the discrepancy between what the theory advocates and what actually occurs.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||but this government -- -- propagandizes its own people every day .||Government press releases , speeches , briefings , tours of military facilities , publications are all propaganda of sorts .||The first sentence asserts that the government engages in daily propaganda directed at its own citizens. The second sentence details specific examples of how this propaganda is disseminated, including press releases, speeches, briefings, tours of military facilities, and publications. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the claim made in the first sentence by providing additional information that illustrates and supports the assertion of widespread government propaganda.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Government press releases , speeches , briefings , tours of military facilities , publications are all propaganda of sorts .||Propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint||The first sentence states that various forms of government communication (press releases, speeches, etc.) are considered propaganda. The second sentence defines propaganda as information used to support a particular viewpoint. The contingency relationship is established because the second sentence explains what propaganda is, providing context for why the government communications listed in the first sentence can be considered propaganda. Essentially, the definition of propaganda in the second sentence contingently explains the classification of government communications as propaganda in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The restrictions on viewing and dissemination of Voice material were especially absurd||An agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform||The first sentence states that the restrictions on viewing and dissemination of Voice material were especially absurd. The second sentence explains the reason for considering these restrictions absurd: an agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform. Thus, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, providing the rationale for why the restrictions are seen as absurd.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||It does a first-rate job .||Its budget $ 184 million -- is paid for by you .||The first sentence states that "it" (presumably referring to an entity or project) does a first-rate job, suggesting high quality or effectiveness. The second sentence provides information about the budget of "it," specifically mentioning that the budget is $184 million and is funded by the audience (you). This additional detail expands on the context of the first sentence by explaining who funds the entity or project and how much money is involved, thereby giving more depth to the initial positive assessment. The relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds more information to enhance the understanding of the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||But a 1948 law barred the `` dissemination '' of that material in the U.S. .||The law let scholars , reporters and researchers read texts of VOA material , only at VOA headquarters in Washington , but it barred them from copying texts .||The first sentence states that there was a 1948 law that barred the dissemination of Voice of America (VOA) material in the United States. The second sentence explains how this law was implemented, specifying that while scholars, reporters, and researchers were allowed to read the texts at the VOA headquarters in Washington, they were not permitted to make copies. This additional detail expands on the restriction mentioned in the first sentence by providing specifics about who could access the material and under what conditions. Thus, the second sentence offers an expansion of the information in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||How 's that again ?||You may come by the agency to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying||The first sentence, "How's that again?" indicates a request for clarification or repetition. The second sentence provides specific details about what is allowed at the agency (coming to read) and what is not allowed (copying manually or by photocopying). This detailed information expands upon the initial request for clarification, explaining the rules more thoroughly. Thus, the second sentence is an expansion of the first one, offering additional context or explanation.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||You may come by the agency to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying||What if I tune in my short-wave radio , transcribe an editorial or program , and print it in my newspaper ?||The first sentence outlines a restriction at the agency where one can read materials but cannot copy them, either manually or via photocopying. The second sentence presents a hypothetical scenario where someone listens to a broadcast, transcribes it, and publishes it in their newspaper. The comparison lies in exploring similar actions (copying content) under different circumstances (at the agency versus using a radio broadcast). This comparison suggests considering whether the prohibition against copying at the agency would apply similarly to other methods or sources of reproducing content.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||For a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling||The United States Information Agency , which runs the Voice , changed its position on three key points||The first sentence suggests there was an unexpected turn of events regarding a ruling. The second sentence provides more detail about what that change involved: specifically, the United States Information Agency, which controls the Voice, altered its stance on three significant issues. This additional information expands on the initial statement by specifying who changed their position and how they did so, thereby elaborating on the "funny thing" mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the second sentence serves to expand the narrative presented in the first one.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'rather'] ||-- The USIA said that , on reflection , of course I could print anything I could get my hands on .||The word dissemination , it decided , referred only to itself .||In the first sentence, the USIA acknowledges that the speaker can print any information they obtain. In the second sentence, the USIA clarifies that the term "dissemination" applies specifically to its own actions. The second sentence expands on the first by providing more detail about the scope of what the speaker can print (any information obtained) and specifying that the USIA's concern with dissemination pertains only to its own activities. The clarification in the second sentence deepens the understanding of the USIA's stance expressed in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The word dissemination , it decided , referred only to itself .||The USIA officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the USIA to disseminate agency program materials in the United States||The first sentence indicates that the term "dissemination" was determined to refer only to itself, suggesting a specific definition or scope was agreed upon. The second sentence details the USIA's declaration regarding the right to disseminate agency program materials. This declaration can be seen as contingent on the agreed-upon definition of "dissemination," as it outlines who has the right to perform the action that the term "dissemination" refers to. The USIA's official stance is in direct response to the understanding of what "dissemination" means in this context, making the relationship between the sentences one of contingency.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The USIA officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the USIA to disseminate agency program materials in the United States||The court noted the new USIA position but , just in case , officially found `` that Congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating USIA information domestically . ''||In the first sentence, the USIA makes a declaration about the right to disseminate its program materials within the U.S., excluding itself from this right. The second sentence describes a court noting this new position and issuing a ruling to affirm that Congress did not intend to prevent the plaintiffs from disseminating USIA information domestically. This ruling expands upon the initial declaration by providing a legal perspective that supports the USIA's stance, ensuring that the plaintiffs' rights are not infringed. Thus, the court's finding expands the implications of the USIA's declaration, reinforcing the rights of others to disseminate USIA information.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||that , on reflection , anyone could view the VOA materials , not just the reporters , scholars , researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute||The USIA publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials , notwithstanding the statutory designations ,||The first sentence states that anyone could view the VOA materials, not just specific groups mentioned in the statute. The second sentence expands on this idea by providing additional information about how the USIA publicly and officially confirmed that all people are allowed access to the materials, regardless of the groups mentioned in the statute. The second sentence further explains and supports the initial statement, broadening its scope to include the official stance of the USIA.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||that all of us could take extensive notes||that persons who examine the materials may make notes and , while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes , no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken||The first sentence states that everyone can take extensive notes. The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining how individuals examining the materials can make notes. It also provides additional context about the agency's position on verbatim notes and the lack of enforcement. This additional information broadens the scope of the note-taking mentioned in the first sentence, hence the relationship of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||But the court disagreed .||`` The First Amendment proscribes the government from passing laws abridging the right to free speech , '' Judge Donald O'Brien ruled .||The first sentence states that the court disagreed with something. The second sentence provides additional information about what the court's stance was through Judge Donald O'Brien's ruling. Specifically, it explains that the court's disagreement was based on the First Amendment's prohibition against the government passing laws that restrict free speech. This additional detail expands on the nature of the court's disagreement, making the relationship between the two sentences one of expansion.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||The First Amendment proscribes the government from passing laws abridging the right to free speech||`` The First Amendment does not prescribe a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press . ''||The first sentence states what the First Amendment does proscribe: it prevents the government from abridging the right to free speech. The second sentence discusses what the First Amendment does not do: it does not impose a duty on the government to ensure easy access to information for the press. These sentences establish a comparison by contrasting what the First Amendment prohibits with what it does not require. This contrast highlights the limitations and scope of the First Amendment's protections, specifically regarding the press and information access.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||So the next step is to try to get the law changed .||to get three words -- `` for examination only '' -- eliminated from the law||The first sentence outlines the goal of changing the law.The second sentence provides specific details on what part of the law needs to be changed: removing the phrase "for examination only".Thus, the second sentence expands upon the first by giving more detail about the exact change desired in the law. The relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where additional information clarifies the initial statement.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Voice material shall be available to certain of us but now , thanks to the USIA 's new position , all of us `` for examination only||If those words were n't there , the nice people at the Voice would be able to send you the information or , at the very least , let you photocopy it .||The first sentence states that voice material will be available to some but, due to the USIA's new position, it can only be used for examination by all. The second sentence describes what would happen if there were no restrictions: the Voice could send the information or allow photocopying. The comparison is between the current situation (with restrictions) and an alternative scenario (without restrictions). It contrasts the limitations imposed by the USIA's policy with what would be possible without those constraints.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||You have ... raised important questions which ought to be answered : ? ''||What does USIA say about America abroad||The first sentence indicates that there are important questions that need answering. The second sentence specifies one of those questions, which is "What does USIA say about America abroad?". Thus, the second sentence expands upon the first by providing an example of the questions that ought to be answered, making the relationship between the two sentences one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||What does USIA say about America abroad||how do we say it||The first sentence asks about the content of what the USIA (presumably the United States Information Agency) says about America abroad. The second sentence expands on this question by asking specifically about the manner or language used in conveying that message. The expansion relationship is demonstrated through the second sentence providing additional detail or specificity regarding the nature of the communication by the USIA.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||`` a man wrote me a couple of years ago .||The man was Charles Z. Wick .||The first sentence states that a man wrote to the speaker a couple of years ago. The identity of this man is unspecified. The second sentence reveals the identity of the man: Charles Z. Wick. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information provided in the first sentence by specifying who the man was. This establishes an expansion relationship, as more details are added to the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Wall Street reacted favorably to Mr. McGovern 's departure and its implications .||In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Campbell 's shares rose $ 3.375 to close at $ 47.125 .||The first sentence states that Wall Street had a positive reaction to Mr. McGovern's departure and its implications. The second sentence provides specific details about how this positive reaction manifested: Campbell's shares rose significantly in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The second sentence expands on the positive reaction mentioned in the first sentence by giving concrete evidence of this reaction through the increase in share prices.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The profit motive of the major shareholders has clearly changed for the better||Mr. McGovern was widely seen as sales , and not profit , oriented .||The first sentence indicates a positive change in the profit motive of the major shareholders. The second sentence provides context by describing Mr. McGovern's orientation towards sales rather than profits. This suggests that the change in the profit motive of the major shareholders might have been influenced by or in response to Mr. McGovern's sales-oriented approach. Thus, the shift in the profit motive is contingent upon the understanding of Mr. McGovern's priorities, implying a causal connection between the two events.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Mr. McGovern was widely seen as sales , and not profit , oriented .||New managers would think a little more like Wall Street||The first sentence states that Mr. McGovern was perceived as focused on sales rather than profits.The second sentence introduces the idea that new managers would think more like Wall Street, implying a focus on profits or financial metrics. The comparison relationship is established through the contrast in managerial approaches: Mr. McGovern's emphasis on sales versus the new managers' expected focus on profit, similar to Wall Street's perspective. This comparison highlights differing priorities and philosophies.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Campbell 's international businesses , particularly in the U.K. and Italy , appear to be at the heart of its problems .||Growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in U.S. units .||The first sentence states that Campbell's international businesses, especially those in the U.K. and Italy, seem to be central to its issues. The second sentence details some specific issues: growth not meeting targets and lower operating earnings compared to U.S. units. The expansion relationship is evident as the second sentence expands on the problems mentioned in the first sentence by providing more detailed information about the nature of these problems (growth shortfall and earnings disparity).
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Mr. Baum , , will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the Pepperidge Farm unit .||Mr. Harper , , will take charge of all overseas operations as well as Pepperidge .||The first sentence outlines the responsibilities of Mr. Baum, specifying that he will oversee all domestic operations except for the Pepperidge Farm unit. The second sentence details Mr. Harper's responsibilities, stating he will manage all overseas operations along with Pepperidge. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the scope of their responsibilities, particularly regarding the Pepperidge Farm unit, which Mr. Baum does not oversee domestically but falls under Mr. Harper's global oversight. This highlights the different areas each executive will manage within the company.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Mr. McGovern was n't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure||The company 's prepared statement quoted him as saying , `` The CEO succession is well along and I 've decided for personal reasons to take early retirement . ''||The first sentence indicates that Mr. McGovern was not available for discussing his departure. The second sentence presents a quote from Mr. McGovern through the company’s prepared statement, where he explains his decision to retire early due to personal reasons and mentions the progress in CEO succession. While both sentences convey information related to Mr. McGovern's departure, they do not directly contrast or provide alternatives. Instead, the comparison here lies in the difference between his unavailability for discussion and the formal statement provided by the company. This highlights a discrepancy between his personal absence and the official communication regarding his departure, creating a comparative context.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'however'] ||Mr. McGovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of 65 in October 1991 , `` unless I get fired . ''||Mr. McGovern had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting , scheduled for Nov. 17||The first sentence states Mr. McGovern's intention to stay until he reached the conventional retirement age, barring any unforeseen circumstances like being fired. The second sentence describes an action taken by Mr. McGovern, withdrawing his name as a candidate for re-election as a director. The comparison relationship can be seen through the contrast between Mr. McGovern's original plan to stay until retirement and his decision to withdraw from re-election, suggesting a change in his plans that is akin to the unexpected scenario (getting fired) mentioned earlier. This establishes a comparison between what he planned and what he actually did.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||For fiscal 1989 , Mr. McGovern received a salary of $ 877,663 .||He owns about 45,000 shares of Campbell stock and has options to buy more than 100,000 additional shares .||The first sentence provides information about Mr. McGovern's salary for fiscal 1989.The second sentence gives further details about his financial stake in the company, specifically mentioning his share ownership and options to purchase more shares. This additional detail expands on Mr. McGovern's financial situation beyond just his salary, giving a broader picture of his compensation and investment in the company. Therefore, the second sentence expands the description of Mr. McGovern's financial position within the company.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||He owns about 45,000 shares of Campbell stock and has options to buy more than 100,000 additional shares .||He will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $ 244,000 with certain other fringe benefits .||The first sentence provides information about the individual's share ownership and options in Campbell stock. The second sentence details further benefits he is entitled to, specifically an annual pension and other fringe benefits. These sentences both describe different forms of compensation or benefits the individual receives, and the second expands on the overall package of benefits he enjoys, including financial assets and entitlements.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||he and Mr. Harper both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early 1988||You 've got to make the restructuring work||The first sentence indicates that both he and Mr. Harper advocated for closing some plants in early 1988. The second sentence expresses the necessity of making the restructuring work. The contingency relationship is evident here because the need to make the restructuring work (second sentence) is contingent upon the earlier advocacy for plant closures (first sentence). The advocacy for closures implies a restructuring effort, and the second sentence reflects the imperative to ensure that this restructuring is successful.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||You 've got to make the restructuring work||`` You 've got to make those savings now . ''||The first sentence states that one needs to make the restructuring work. The second sentence expands on what "making the restructuring work" entails: making savings now. This means the second sentence provides additional detail or elaborates on the requirement mentioned in the first sentence, thus creating an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||that he and Mr. Baum can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company||We look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team||In the first sentence, the speaker expresses the goal of convincing the board of their worthiness to run the company. In the second sentence, the speaker elaborates on this goal by framing it as an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of their management team. The second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first one by providing additional context about what they aim to prove with their worthiness - specifically, that they have a strong management team. This additional detail supports and enhances the initial statement, illustrating the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||`` We look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team , '' he said .||He predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive .||In the first sentence, the speaker expresses confidence in their management team by stating that they see an upcoming situation as a chance to demonstrate their capabilities. In the second sentence, more context is provided about the situation, specifically that the board will allow the current management team until early next year before appointing a new chief executive. This additional information expands on the context of the "great opportunity" mentioned in the first sentence, explaining when and how the team will have the chance to prove themselves. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||In the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon , both men exuded confidence and seemed to work well together .||`` You 've got two champions sitting right before you , '' said Mr. Baum .||The first sentence states that during the interview at headquarters, both men appeared confident and worked well together.The second sentence provides additional detail about the nature of the relationship between the two men, with Mr. Baum describing them as two champions sitting before him. This further expands on the idea that they not only work well together but also excel in their field, reinforcing the positive dynamic mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the description of the relationship between the two men by adding more specific praise for their abilities and compatibility.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||You 've got two champions sitting right before you||`` We play to win .||The first sentence states that there are two champions sitting before the speaker.The second sentence provides additional information about these champions by explaining their mindset or approach to playing, which is "We play to win." The second sentence expands on the nature or characteristics of the champions mentioned in the first sentence by giving insight into their competitive spirit or attitude, hence forming an expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||A successor was n't named , which fueled speculation that Mr. Bernstein may have clashed with S.I. Newhouse Jr. , .||Abrupt departures are n't unheard of within the Newhouse empire .||The first sentence indicates that no successor was named for Mr. Bernstein, leading to speculation about potential reasons, including a possible clash with S.I. Newhouse Jr. The second sentence provides context about the corporate culture by mentioning that abrupt departures are not uncommon within the Newhouse empire. This information is contingent upon the initial speculation, as it offers a plausible explanation or precedent for Mr. Bernstein's departure without a named successor. The fact that abrupt departures are not unheard of supports the speculation that Mr. Bernstein's exit could have been sudden and possibly related to internal conflicts.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||In an interview , Mr. Bernstein said his departure `` evolved out of discussions with Si Newhouse and that 's the decision I reached . ''||He declined to elaborate , other than to say , `` It just seemed the right thing to do at this minute .||In the first sentence, Mr. Bernstein explains his departure by attributing it to discussions with Si Newhouse and stating it as his reached decision. In the second sentence, when asked for further details, Mr. Bernstein refrains from elaborating but reiterates his stance by saying it "just seemed the right thing to do at this minute." Both sentences convey Mr. Bernstein's perspective on his departure, with the second sentence offering a similar rationale to the first one but using different words. This establishes a comparison between the two sentences, as they both express Mr. Bernstein's justification for his departure.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||that he is n't unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House , the largest trade publishing house in the U.S.||the publisher 's annual sales volume increased to $ 800 million from $ 40 million during Mr. Bernstein 's tenure||The first sentence states that the subject (implied) is not unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House. The second sentence provides specific evidence supporting the claim that Random House has performed well under Mr. Bernstein’s leadership: the significant increase in the publisher's annual sales volume during his tenure. This detail expands on the initial statement by giving concrete reasons for the lack of unhappiness, thus deepening our understanding of the subject's positive view.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||the publisher 's annual sales volume increased to $ 800 million from $ 40 million during Mr. Bernstein 's tenure||Bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly||The first sentence indicates significant growth in the publisher's annual sales volume during Mr. Bernstein's tenure.The second sentence praises Bob for handling the company's extraordinary growth brilliantly. The relationship is one of expansion: the growth mentioned in the first sentence is the same growth referred to in the second sentence, and the second sentence expands on how well this growth was managed by Bob.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Pragmatic cause', 'as'] ||Bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly||`` The company is doing well , it 's stable , it 's got good people .||The first sentence indicates that Bob has managed the company's significant growth effectively. The second sentence provides details about the state of the company, mentioning its stability and strong workforce. These positive attributes of the company can be seen as the outcome or result of Bob's effective management. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the condition of the company is contingent upon Bob's successful handling of its growth.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||`` The company is doing well , it 's stable , it 's got good people .||Bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time . ''||The first sentence speaks positively about the company, mentioning its stability and good employees. The second sentence introduces Bob and his agenda, suggesting a particular timing. The comparison relationship here can be explained as contrasting or comparing the positive state of the company with Bob's introduction and his agenda. The mention of the company doing well and being stable is compared with Bob's actions and timing, implying that despite the company's good condition, Bob has his own motivations for acting at this specific time.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years , some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily||Crown Publishing Group , acquired last year , is said to be turning in disappointing results .||The first sentence states that while Random House experienced significant growth and successfully integrated various acquisitions, some larger acquisitions did not integrate as smoothly. The second sentence provides an example of one such acquisition - Crown Publishing Group - that was purchased but is reportedly performing poorly. The relationship is one of expansion, where the second sentence expands on the point made in the first by giving specific details about an acquisition that did not perform as expected. It offers additional information to support the claim that not all acquisitions were successful.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house .||Possible candidates include Susan Petersen , president of Ballantine/Del Rey/Fawcett , Random House 's huge and successful paperback division .||The first sentence introduces the topic of speculation regarding potential successors, mentioning that division heads at the company are being considered.The second sentence provides specific examples of such division heads, naming Susan Petersen as a possible candidate and giving details about her role and the division she leads. This detailed information expands on the initial statement about division heads being considered as successors, hence the relationship is one of expansion.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Possible candidates include Susan Petersen , president of Ballantine/Del Rey/Fawcett , Random House 's huge and successful paperback division .||Some say Anthony Cheetham , head of a recently acquired British company , Century Hutchinson , could be chosen .||The first sentence introduces Susan Petersen as a possible candidate for a position due to her role at Random House's paperback division.The second sentence presents Anthony Cheetham as another potential candidate who could also be selected, based on his position at Century Hutchinson.Both individuals are being considered for the same unspecified position, and the fact that they both are viable candidates sets up a comparison between them. The relationship between the sentences is one of comparison because they both present different candidates for the same role.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Not included on the most-likely-successor list are Joni Evans , recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House , and Sonny Mehta , president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit .||When Ms. Evans took her job , several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time administrator . Mr. Mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently .||The first sentence states that Joni Evans and Sonny Mehta are not included on the most-likely-successor list for a position. The second sentence provides reasons for their exclusion: For Joni Evans, important divisions were not included when she took her job, partly due to her not wishing to be a full-time administrator; and for Sonny Mehta, he is known as a brilliant editor but less so as an administrator, with rumors of his own departure circulating recently. These reasons explain why they are not considered likely successors, establishing a contingent relationship between the sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||When Ms. Evans took her job , several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time administrator .||Mr. Mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently .||The first sentence explains that when Ms. Evans took her job, some important divisions were not included in her responsibilities, partly because she did not want to be a full-time administrator. The second sentence provides context for Ms. Evans' preference by mentioning Mr. Mehta, who is known as a brilliant editor but not as strong an administrator, with rumors of his departure. This suggests that the environment or culture may involve a recognition of the importance of focusing on strengths rather than administrative duties, expanding on the reason for Ms. Evans not wanting a full administrative role. The mention of Mr. Mehta's situation expands on the context of why Ms. Evans might have similar reservations about taking on extensive administrative duties.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional .||The appropriations clause states that `` No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law ... . '' The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding .||The first sentence asserts that a particular type of congressional action is based on an incorrect and unconstitutional understanding of the appropriations clause. The second sentence expands on this by providing more details about what the appropriations clause actually says and describing the common interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill. This expansion helps to clarify the nature of the "erroneous and unconstitutional" interpretation mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the second sentence provides additional information that supports and explains the claim made in the first sentence, establishing an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding .||This interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in 1987 in the Iran-Contra Report .||The first sentence outlines the prevailing interpretation of a specific clause, indicating that it grants Congress the power to veto presidential actions by withholding funding. The second sentence expands on this idea by providing historical context, specifically mentioning that Congress officially endorsed this interpretation in 1987 through the Iran-Contra Report. Therefore, the second sentence offers additional information that supports and elaborates on the initial statement, establishing an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||As partisans of congressional power understand , a `` power of the purse '' so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers .||It is not supported by the text or history of the Constitution .||The first sentence explains the perspective of partisans of congressional power, suggesting that a broadly construed "power of the purse" could weaken the presidency and undermine the separation of powers. The second sentence elaborates on this idea by stating that such a broad interpretation is not supported by the Constitution's text or history. Thus, the second sentence expands on the implications of the first sentence by providing additional context about why the broadly construed power is problematic from a constitutional standpoint.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , according to Madison 's notes .||To the extent they did , their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability .||The first sentence states that the framers did not extensively discuss the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention, based on Madison's notes. The second sentence then narrows down the scope of their discussion, specifying that when they did talk about it, their focus was on ensuring fiscal accountability. This establishes a comparison by contrasting the limited nature of their discussions with the specific concern they had when they did discuss the topic. It highlights what was important to them within the context of their limited discussion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money .||During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable .||The first sentence outlines the situation where Congress has included provisions in the appropriations bill that could be seen as overreaching its powers. The second sentence presents the decision that President Bush faces in response to these provisions: either veto the bills or sign them with a statement declaring certain parts unconstitutional.The contingency relationship is evident because President Bush's decision (the second sentence) is dependent on the contents of the appropriations bill (the first sentence). His actions are contingent upon the specific provisions included in the bill by Congress.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'since'] ||Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing .||The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary .||The first sentence states that Section 605 places unconstitutional restrictions on the President's ability to nominate candidates. The second sentence explains one specific implication of the language used in the appropriations rider, which is part of Section 605, suggesting that if a nominee is rejected, any future nomination to any position by that same individual would result in the President not receiving funding for that person's salary. This shows that the restriction mentioned in the first sentence (unconstitutional conditions on nominations) leads to the specific outcome described in the second sentence (denial of funding for salaries). The second sentence's content is contingent upon the conditions imposed in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary .||The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government .||The first sentence outlines the implication of the appropriations rider - that if a nominee who was previously rejected is nominated again for any position, the president would not receive funding for that person's salary. The second sentence expands on this limitation by explaining an additional constraint: the Anti-Deficiency Act prevents individuals from volunteering services to the government, which means the president cannot circumvent the restriction by having nominees serve without pay. This further clarifies the extent of the limitation imposed by the appropriations rider.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Muzzling provisions , which might be called `` blindfold laws '' as well , prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options , let alone from recommending them to Congress .||Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations .||The first sentence introduces the concept of muzzling provisions, also referred to as "blindfold laws," which restrict the executive branch's ability to consider certain policy options.The second sentence discusses a law that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress but allows the president to choose the topics of those recommendations. The comparison relationship is evident when contrasting the restrictions imposed by muzzling provisions with the discretionary power granted to the president under Article II. The two laws are being compared in terms of how they affect the president's ability to propose policies to Congress.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny .||There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other .||The first sentence states that there is a proviso in the appropriations bill which stops the President's Office of Management and Budget from analyzing agricultural marketing orders through a cost-benefit approach. The second sentence explains why this situation is problematic, suggesting that it is suspicious for Congress to prevent the executive branch from investigating potential waste of public funds.The second sentence expands on the issue introduced in the first sentence by highlighting the broader implications of Congress preventing the executive branch from studying the cost-effectiveness of programs. It delves into the questionable nature of such prohibitions, thereby providing additional context and reasoning for why the initial example is considered egregious.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives .||If President Bush fails to do so in his first year , he will invite Congress , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes .||The first sentence recommends that President Bush should veto certain appropriations acts due to their unconstitutional conditions. The second sentence presents a potential consequence if President Bush does not follow this recommendation during his first year in office: Congress may feel encouraged to further challenge or alter presidential powers throughout his presidency. The contingency relationship is established through the implication that the future behavior of Congress (rewriting Article II) is dependent on President Bush's initial action (or inaction) regarding the vetoes.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||President Reagan learned that lesson .||By 1987 , then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II .||The first sentence states that President Reagan learned a particular lesson, but does not specify what the lesson is or provide context. The second sentence offers more detail by describing a specific scenario in 1987 involving Speaker Jim Wright, Mikhail Gorbachev, and actions related to arms control and the Senate's role in ratifying SALT II. This additional information expands on the context in which President Reagan learned the unspecified lesson, providing background and circumstances surrounding the learning experience. Therefore, the second sentence expands upon the first by providing contextual details about the lesson Reagan learned.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable .||The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power .||The first sentence outlines a potential course of action for the President if faced with a situation where a veto is unworkable: signing the appropriations bills and asserting a power of excision to declare certain restrictions unconstitutional and severable. The second sentence states that the Constitution does not explicitly grant the President this power. These sentences present a comparison between an action that could be taken (asserting a power of excision) and the lack of explicit constitutional authority for such an action. The relationship is one of comparison, contrasting the proposed action with the constitutional basis for it.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||However , the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution .||The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto .||The first sentence asserts that the president has a duty not to violate the Constitution. The second sentence raises a question about the president's means of defense, specifically whether the veto is his only option. This question can be seen as arising from the context set by the first sentence, which discusses the president's constitutional responsibilities. Thus, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, as it explores a potential implication of the president's duty to uphold the Constitution.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto .||As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives . The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability .||The first sentence introduces the concept of excising appropriations riders that encroach on the president's duties under Article II, distinguishing it from a line-item veto. The second sentence discusses the line-item veto in the context of controlling federal spending and clarifies its nature and scope. The contingency relationship is established because the discussion of the line-item veto (second sentence) is contingent upon the introduction of the related but distinct concept of excising certain appropriations riders (first sentence). The second sentence depends on the first for context and contrast.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives .||The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability .||The first sentence discusses the use of the line-item veto to remove constitutional provisions from spending bills based on policy disagreements. The second sentence introduces another scenario: the removal of unconstitutional conditions from an appropriations bill. The comparison lies in contrasting the scope and application of removing constitutional versus unconstitutional provisions. By stating that the latter would be a power of "far more limited applicability," the text implies that there would be fewer instances where such a power would be applicable, compared to the broader potential use of the line-item veto described in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability .||One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers .||The first sentence states that the removal of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill is a power with limited application. The second sentence further explains this idea by discussing how this power can be used to oppose unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers, and it argues that this may not even be considered an item veto. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by providing additional context and argument about the nature and scope of the excision power.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills .||If Congress does nothing , President Bush will have won . If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court assuming it can establish standing to sue , President Bush might win .||The first sentence states there is no downside for the president if he asserts a right over unconstitutional conditions in certain bills. The second sentence discusses potential outcomes based on actions Congress may take (or not take). If Congress chooses not to act, President Bush wins. If they choose to take legal action, President Bush could still win. The outcomes (President Bush winning) are contingent upon the actions (or inaction) of Congress.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||If Congress does nothing , President Bush will have won .||If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court assuming it can establish standing to sue , President Bush might win .||The first sentence outlines a scenario where, if Congress takes no action, President Bush will have won.The second sentence expands on the potential outcomes by introducing another scenario: if Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court, President Bush might still win. This additional scenario further explores the potential resolutions and their implications for President Bush, thus expanding on the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court assuming it can establish standing to sue , President Bush might win .||In that case , he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive .||The first sentence outlines a scenario where Congress takes a dispute to the Supreme Court, and President Bush might win if Congress can establish standing to sue. The second sentence expands on the potential outcome for President Bush, suggesting that he could receive an opinion from the court affirming his rights and prerogatives as the executive. The second sentence provides additional information about what winning could mean for President Bush, thus expanding on the initial scenario presented in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||As it stands now , Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down .||President Bush should set things straight .||The first sentence indicates that there is a current assumption by Congress that the White House will not challenge unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills. The second sentence suggests a course of action for President Bush, which is to "set things straight." This implies that President Bush has the opportunity to change the situation described in the first sentence by taking a different approach. Thus, the action President Bush could take (setting things straight) is contingent upon the existing condition (Congress's assumption about the White House's response).
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as'] ||President Bush should set things straight .||If he does not , he will help realize Madison 's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature `` everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex . ''||The first sentence makes a suggestion that President Bush should take some action (set things straight). The second sentence presents a potential negative outcome if he fails to do so (helping to realize Madison's fear). Here, the contingency relationship is established because the occurrence of the event described in the second sentence (Madison's fear being realized) is dependent on President Bush's decision not to take the suggested action (not setting things straight).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Net cash income -- -- increased in 33 states in 1988 , as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices||Most of those states set farm income records .||The first sentence states that net cash income increased in 33 states in 1988 due to a drought that reduced crop yields and raised commodity prices. The second sentence provides additional information about these states, noting that most of them set farm income records. This expansion of information helps to clarify the extent of the increase in income by specifying that the increase was significant enough to set records in most of these states. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, with the second sentence providing more detail about the situation described in the first.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||What saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had `` mortgaged '' to the government under price-support loan programs .||With prices soaring , they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at `` considerable profit||The first sentence explains how farmers were saved from a bad year due to their ability to reclaim grain and other crops previously mortgaged to the government. The second sentence details the outcome of this reclamation: selling the commodities at a considerable profit due to soaring prices. Thus, the farmers' ability to make a profit was contingent upon their reclaiming the commodities and the high market prices. The relationship between the sentences is one of contingency because the profit was dependent on the reclamation and the market conditions.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Despite federal disaster relief , the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers , according to the department .||Many lost their farms .||The first sentence states that the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated number of farmers, despite federal disaster relief. The second sentence provides additional information about the impact of the drought by stating that many farmers lost their farms. This sentence expands on the severity of the financial setback mentioned in the first sentence, illustrating the consequence of the setback. Thus, the second sentence offers more detail and elaboration on the impact of the drought, creating an expansion relationship with the first sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Last year , government payments to farmers slipped to less than $ 14.5 billion from a record $ 16.7 billion in 1987 .||Payments are expected to range between $ 9 billion and $ 12 billion this year .||The first sentence provides information about the amount of government payments to farmers last year, which was less than $14.5 billion, down from a record $16.7 billion in 1987. The second sentence offers an expectation for the current year's payments, projecting them to be between $9 billion and $12 billion. The comparison relationship is established through the contrast in the amounts of government payments over different years. Specifically, the payments are compared between the previous year, 1987, and the current year, showing a decrease from the record high and a further expected reduction.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||The demise of the 238,000-circulation Herald , once the nation 's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding 700,000 , turns the country 's second-largest city into a one-newspaper town , at least in some senses .||The Los Angeles Times , with a circulation of more than 1.1 million , dominates the region . But it faces stiff competition in Orange County from the Orange County Register , which sells more than 300,000 copies a day , and in the San Fernando Valley from the Los Angeles Daily News , which sells more than 170,000 . Nearby cities such as Pasadena and Long Beach also have large dailies .||The first sentence discusses the closure of the Herald and its impact on the city, turning it into a one-newspaper town. The second sentence expands on the context by providing additional information about other newspapers in the region, including the dominance of the Los Angeles Times and the competition it faces from the Orange County Register and the Los Angeles Daily News. This additional detail broadens the context of the first sentence, explaining the competitive landscape of newspapers in the area, which is why the relationship is considered Expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as `` tire-kickers and lookee-loos '' had filed through since .||The prospective buyers included investor Marvin Davis and the Toronto Sun .||The first sentence mentions a stream of people referred to disparagingly as "tire-kickers and lookee-loos" visiting, suggesting they are potential buyers who may not be serious.The second sentence provides specific examples of the prospective buyers, including Marvin Davis and the Toronto Sun, thereby expanding on who these visitors were. The relationship between the sentences is one of expansion, where more details are given about the nature of the visitors mentioned in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The death of the Herald , a newsstand paper in a freeway town , was perhaps inevitable .||Los Angeles is a sprawling , balkanized newspaper market , and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the mammoth Times , then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies .||The first sentence states that the death of the Herald, a newsstand paper, was likely inevitable. The second sentence explains part of the reason for this inevitability: advertisers had the option to buy space in the larger Los Angeles Times and also target specific areas with regional dailies. This situation made it challenging for the Herald to compete, contributing to its eventual demise. Therefore, the second sentence provides a contingent factor that influenced the outcome described in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the mammoth Times , then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies .||The Herald was left in limbo .||The first sentence indicates a strategy advertisers used, which involves buying space in a large newspaper like the Times and then targeting specific areas using regional dailies. The second sentence describes the situation of the Herald being "left in limbo." The Herald's uncertain position can be seen as a consequence of the advertising strategy described in the first sentence. Advertisers' preference for the combination of a major newspaper and targeted regional dailies likely impacted the Herald's ad revenue and market position, leading to its uncertain state. Therefore, the relationship between the sentences is one of contingency, where the situation of the Herald is contingent upon the actions of advertisers.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Further , the Herald seemed torn editorially between keeping its old-time Hearst readership -- -- and trying to provide a sprightly , upscale alternative to the sometimes staid Times .||Hearst had flirted with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan .||The first sentence indicates that the Herald is experiencing an internal conflict over its approach to maintaining its traditional Hearst readership while also attempting to present itself as a more vibrant and upscale option compared to the Times.The second sentence expands on the Herald's history of considering changes to appeal to readers by mentioning that Hearst had considered switching to a tabloid format for many years but never carried out the plan. This additional information provides context for the Herald's current struggle, suggesting a longstanding pattern of contemplating significant changes to attract or retain readers. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the internal conflict described in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The Herald joins the Baltimore News-American , which folded , and the Boston Herald-American , which was sold , as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s .||Many felt Hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did , if marginally , because of its place in family history .||The first sentence states that The Herald, along with the Baltimore News-American and the Boston Herald-American, were part of the old Hearst newspaper empire but were later abandoned by the company in the 1980s. The second sentence provides additional context by explaining why many believed Hearst maintained the paper for as long as it did, even if only marginally, due to its significance in family history. This detail expands on the reason behind Hearst's commitment to the paper, offering insight into the company's decision-making process and the emotional connection to the newspaper.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Many felt Hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did , if marginally , because of its place in family history .||Its fanciful offices were designed by architect Julia Morgan , who built the Hearst castle at San Simeon .||The first sentence indicates that many people believed Hearst maintained the paper due to its significance in family history. The second sentence adds information about the connection to the family history by mentioning that the paper's offices were designed by Julia Morgan, the same architect who built the Hearst Castle. This additional detail expands on the initial idea of the paper's importance to the family by providing a specific example of how it is intertwined with the family legacy through the design of its offices. Therefore, the relationship is one of expansion, where the second sentence broadens the context of the first by adding relevant details.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Its fanciful offices were designed by architect Julia Morgan , who built the Hearst castle at San Simeon .||William Randolph Hearst had kept an apartment in the Spanish Renaissance-style building .||The first sentence introduces the designer of the building, Julia Morgan, and notes her work on the Hearst Castle. The second sentence adds information about William Randolph Hearst having an apartment in the Spanish Renaissance-style building. This creates an expansion by providing additional context about the building's historical significance through its association with Hearst. The relationship is one of expansion, as the second sentence broadens our understanding of the building’s history and its connection to Hearst, following the initial mention of Julia Morgan's design.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||the Herald 's demise does n't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry||The Herald was a survivor from a bygone age||The first sentence states that the Herald's failure doesn't indicate the general state of the newspaper industry. The second sentence explains that the Herald was a survivor from a past era. This suggests that the Herald's unique history and context (being a remnant of an earlier time) could explain why its situation isn't reflective of the broader industry. Thus, the second sentence provides additional information that contingently supports the claim made in the first sentence, explaining why the Herald's experience may not be indicative of the entire industry.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Founded as the Examiner in 1903 by Mr. Hearst , the Herald was crippled by a bitter , decade-long strike that began in 1967 and cut circulation in half .||Financially , it never recovered||The first sentence states that the Herald, originally founded as the Examiner in 1903 by Mr. Hearst, suffered from a long strike that started in 1967, leading to a significant drop in circulation. The second sentence provides additional information about the financial impact of the strike by stating that the Herald never recovered financially. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence elaborates on the consequences of the strike mentioned in the first sentence, specifically detailing its lasting financial effects.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Financially , it never recovered||editorially , it had its moments||The first part of the sentence, "Financially, it never recovered," indicates a negative outcome in terms of finances. The second part, "editorially, it had its moments," suggests some positive aspects from an editorial perspective. These two clauses are compared to show a contrast between the financial struggles and the editorial successes. The use of "financially" versus "editorially" highlights this comparison, demonstrating different outcomes in each area.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||editorially , it had its moments||In 1979 , Hearst hired editor James Bellows , who brightened the editorial product considerably .||The first sentence states that the editorial content had some good points or "moments."The second sentence provides specific information about what led to these positive moments: the hiring of editor James Bellows in 1979, who improved the editorial product. The second sentence expands on the first by giving details about the reason for the positive aspects mentioned in the first sentence, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||Hearst said it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for 60 days .||Some long-tenured employees will receive additional benefits||The first sentence outlines what Hearst said it would do for its employees: providing a placement service and paying them for 60 days. The second sentence adds more detail by specifying that some long-tenured employees will receive additional benefits. This additional information expands on the original statement by explaining that there are further benefits for certain employees, beyond the initial offerings mentioned. Thus, the second sentence provides an expansion of the details related to the benefits provided by Hearst.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The reaction in the newsroom was emotional .||I 've never seen so many people crying in one place at one time||The first sentence states that the reaction in the newsroom was emotional.The second sentence provides more specific details about what the emotional reaction looked like: many people were crying.This detail (people crying) helps to expand upon the initial statement about the emotional reaction, offering a clearer picture of the atmosphere in the newsroom. Thus, the second sentence expands on the description of the emotional reaction from the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Alternative', 'instead'] ||Outside , a young pressman filling a news box with an extra edition headlined `` Herald Examiner Closes '' refused to take a reader 's quarter .||`` Forget it , '' he said as he handed her a paper .||In the first sentence, we learn about a pressman who is filling a news box with an extra edition announcing the closure of the Herald Examiner and refusing to take a reader's money. In the second sentence, the pressman's action of refusal is further detailed by his dialogue, where he says "Forget it," and hands the reader a paper. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by providing additional information about how the pressman interacted with the reader and carried out his refusal to take payment.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Forget it||`` It does n't make any difference now .||The first sentence "Forget it" implies a dismissal or disregard for something. The second sentence "It doesn't make any difference now" explains a reason for the dismissal, indicating that the situation has changed to a point where the issue is no longer relevant or impactful. Thus, the speaker's command to forget something is contingent upon the fact that the matter is no longer significant. The contingency relationship is established because the advice to forget is based on the situation no longer mattering.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as'] ||Or so the slogan might go .||American Express Co. and General Motors Corp. 's beleaguered Buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting Buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the American Express card .||The first sentence introduces a hypothetical slogan, suggesting a promotional concept. The second sentence details a specific partnership between American Express Co. and General Motors Corp.'s Buick division for a promotion. The contingency relationship is established because the partnership described in the second sentence could be seen as an actualization of the promotional idea hinted at in the first sentence. The slogan's concept is contingent upon or leads to the detailed promotion in the second sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||but `` hopefully will be the first of many '' in the company 's effort to promote its green card as `` the total car-care card||To that end , American Express has been signing up gasoline companies , car repair shops , tire companies and car dealers to accept the card .||The first sentence indicates a goal or hope for the future regarding the promotion of the Green Card as a comprehensive car care solution. The second sentence describes actions taken by American Express to sign up various automotive-related businesses to accept the card. These actions are contingent upon the goal expressed in the first sentence, meaning they are taken with the aim of achieving the desired outcome of promoting the card widely in the car care industry.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||In addition , Buick is a relatively respected nameplate among American Express card holders||When the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases , Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars||The first sentence states that Buick is a relatively respected nameplate among American Express card holders. The second sentence provides evidence of this respect by detailing the results of a survey where Buick ranked highly among the cars that American Express card holders were interested in. This detail expands on the initial claim of Buick's respect among this demographic, thus establishing an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||GMAC screened the card-member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $ 45,000 who had n't `` missed any payments||Some 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC .||The first sentence outlines the criteria GMAC used to screen card members for its offer: they must be over 30 years old, have a household income over $45,000, and have no missed payments. The second sentence provides additional information about the outcome of this screening process: 3.8 million out of five million selected card members were pre-approved for credit. This detail expands upon the initial criteria by specifying how many card members met those conditions and were thus pre-approved, demonstrating the Expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a sweepstakes with Buick cars or a Hawaii vacation as prizes .||If they test-drive a Buick , they get an American Express calculator .||The first sentence outlines the eligibility of card holders for a sweepstakes with Buick cars or a Hawaii vacation as prizes. The second sentence adds more information about what card holders can receive if they test-drive a Buick, which is an American Express calculator. This additional detail expands on the benefits available to card holders who engage further with Buick, hence the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||This is n't Buick 's first travel-related promotion .||A few years ago , the company offered two round-trip tickets on Trans World Airlines to buyers of its Riviera luxury car .||The first sentence states that this isn't Buick's first travel-related promotion, implying that they've done similar promotions before. The second sentence provides a specific example of a previous travel-related promotion by Buick, which was offering two round-trip tickets with the purchase of its Riviera luxury car. The second sentence expands on the information in the first sentence by providing a concrete instance of a past promotion, supporting the claim that Buick has run travel-related promotions before.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions .||As many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities .||The first sentence states that the ruling could result in the cancellation of significant bank debts incurred by the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham due to losses from swap transactions. The second sentence expands on the implications of this ruling, indicating that up to 70 banks in the UK and internationally could face substantial financial losses if the decision is upheld and becomes a precedent for other municipalities. This shows that the second sentence provides additional information and broader context about the potential impact of the ruling mentioned in the first sentence, hence the expansion relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'however'] ||As many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities .||An appeal is expected .||The provided sentences do not naturally illustrate a comparison relationship but rather seem to be sequentially related. However, to fit the instruction, we can interpret the relationship as follows:The first sentence discusses the potential financial impact on UK and international banks if a certain decision is upheld. The second sentence mentions that an appeal is expected. Although a direct comparison isn't present, we could infer that the expectation of an appeal is in response to the potential losses, suggesting a comparison between the outcome if the decision stands versus the possibility of a different outcome through appeal. This interpretation stretches the actual relationship, and a true comparison would involve contrasting elements or evaluating similarities.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||In response to the ruling , gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session .||Gilts , or British government bonds , which also fell sharply initially , retraced some of the losses to end about 3/8 point lower .||The first sentence describes the reaction of gilt futures to a ruling, noting they "plunged more than a point" but then recovered much of the loss. The second sentence discusses the initial sharp fall of British government bonds (gilts) and their partial recovery to end "about 3/8 point lower." These sentences present a comparison by detailing similar reactions (sharp falls and partial recovery) from both gilt futures and gilts themselves to the same event (the ruling). The comparison highlights how both were affected similarly by the ruling.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The council , , lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals .||At one point , Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10 % of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings .||The first sentence states that the council lost millions of pounds due to unsuccessful swap deals. The second sentence expands on this information by specifying that at one point, Hammersmith (presumably referring to the council) had a significant presence in the interest-rate swap market, accounting for 10% of the sterling market. This detail explains the extent of the council's involvement in swap dealings, providing context for the magnitude of the losses mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more specific information about the council's activity in swap dealings.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||In most of the British transactions , the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks , which would make fixed-rate payments .||As interest rates rose , municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them .||The first sentence outlines the structure of the financial agreements in British transactions where municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks, while the banks would make fixed-rate payments. The second sentence describes the outcome of these agreements when interest rates rose. The temporal relationship here is that the consequence (municipalities owing the banks more money) occurred after the initial agreements were set up. As interest rates increased over time, the financial imbalance described in the second sentence took place, following the initial setup of the agreements mentioned in the first sentence.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell , district auditor for Hammersmith , who argued that local councils are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities .||The council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal .||The first sentence states that the court hearing started in early October due to a request from Anthony Hazell, who holds the position of district auditor for Hammersmith. He contended that local councils do not possess the constitutional authority to participate in specific capital-market activities.The second sentence indicates that the council supported the audit commission’s stance, which asserts that the swap transactions are unlawful.The temporal relationship is evident here because the council's backing of the audit commission's position likely occurred after the court hearing began. Therefore, the second event (the council supporting the audit commission) happened subsequent to the first event (the commencement of the court hearing), establishing a chronological order.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||If the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal , it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways||Banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils .||The first sentence outlines a scenario where banks, having exhausted all appeals, may want the illegality ruling to apply reciprocally.The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying one potential action banks might take under this scenario: seeking to recover payments made to local authorities when those payments resulted in a net transfer to the councils. The second sentence adds detail to the first by illustrating how the banks could implement the reciprocal application of the ruling.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'rather'] ||But the heated fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market .||The real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards .||The first sentence indicates that the fight over program trading involves more significant issues than just market volatility. The second sentence elaborates on what those bigger issues are, specifying that the core conflict is about control and the financial benefits of the market. Thus, the second sentence expands on the initial claim by providing additional detail about the underlying concerns at stake in the debate over program trading.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'since'] ||The real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards .||Program trading itself , according to many academics who have studied it , is merely caught in the middle of this battle , unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace .||The first sentence identifies that there is a significant battle over controlling a lucrative market. The second sentence discusses how program trading is viewed by academics in the context of this battle. According to these academics, program trading is not actually the cause of the issues but is instead a scapegoat, caught in the middle of the battle for market control. Thus, the characterization of program trading as being "caught in the middle" and "unfairly labeled" is contingent upon the existence of the battle described in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Stung by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot , almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage , a common form of program trading , for their own accounts in the past few days .||A few , such as giant Merrill Lynch & Co. , now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients .||The first sentence states that major investment banking firms have stopped engaging in index arbitrage due to criticism about greed affecting the stock market. The second sentence provides a specific example of a large firm, Merrill Lynch & Co., taking an even more stringent approach by refusing to conduct index arbitrage trades for their clients. The second sentence expands upon the first by giving a particular instance of a company that not only stopped its own index arbitrage but also declined to facilitate such trades for its customers. This further illustrates the extent to which concerns over greed have influenced industry practices.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The Old Guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based , .||Some , such as traditional money manager Neuberger & Berman , have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators `` stop the numbers racket on Wall Street . ''||The first sentence states that The Old Guard's attack on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based. The second sentence provides an example of how this attack has manifested, specifically mentioning Neuberger & Berman taking out national newspaper ads to demand action from market regulators. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by illustrating one aspect of the fierce and broad-based assault mentioned. It gives concrete evidence of the intensity and breadth of the attack by detailing a specific action taken by a member of The Old Guard.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||he has received `` countless '' letters offering support||`` They said universally , without a single exception : Do n't even compromise .||The first sentence states that the person has received numerous letters expressing support. The second sentence details the content of these letters, indicating that every one of them advises against compromising. The second sentence expands upon the first by providing specific information about the nature of the support mentioned in the letters. Specifically, it explains what kind of support was offered in those "countless" letters, thus giving more detail and context to the initial statement.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Do n't even compromise||Kill it||The instruction "Don't even compromise" is compared with the more extreme action "Kill it." The use of "even" suggests a comparison, implying that compromising is less severe than killing it but still not acceptable. Thus, the relationship is one of comparison, where two levels of response (not compromising and killing) are contrasted to emphasize the speaker's point.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as'] ||Wall Street 's New Guard is n't likely to take all this lying down for long , however .||Its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable .||The first sentence suggests that Wall Street's New Guard will react to some unspecified situation or challenge.The second sentence provides information about the profitability of their new products and trading techniques.This profitability could be a reason or motivation for the New Guard to respond assertively to any challenges they face. Therefore, the contingency relationship is established, as the New Guard's likely reaction (not taking things lying down) is contingent upon the success and profitability of their innovations.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable .||Program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country , and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them .||The first sentence states that the new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable. The second sentence expands on this by explaining how program trading money managers, who control a significant portion of invested funds, rely on these techniques to meet the pressure to produce consistent profits. The rapid movement in and out of the market, facilitated by program trading, contributes to their profitability. This detail supports and expands upon the initial claim of high profitability from new trading techniques.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Even some members of the Old Guard , despite their current advantage , seem to be conceding that the future belongs with the New Guard .||Last week , Robert M. Bradley , one of the Big Board 's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders ' organization , surrendered .||The first sentence states that some members of the Old Guard are conceding that the future belongs to the New Guard. The second sentence provides a specific example of this concession through the actions of Robert M. Bradley, a respected figure among floor traders, who "surrendered." This surrender serves as an illustration of the broader point made in the first sentence, providing a concrete instance of an Old Guard member acknowledging the ascendancy of the New Guard. Therefore, the second sentence expands upon the idea introduced in the first sentence by offering a particular case that supports the general statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Last week , Robert M. Bradley , , surrendered .||He sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. in which he said the Big Board is too focused on machines , rather than people .||The first sentence states that Robert M. Bradley surrendered last week. The second sentence provides additional details about what his surrender entailed: selling his exchange seat and writing a critical letter to John J. Phelan Jr., expressing dissatisfaction with the focus on technology over human interaction at the exchange. The second sentence expands on the concept of surrender by explaining specific actions taken by Bradley and the reasons behind his decision, thus providing more context for his surrender.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||the Big Board is too focused on machines , rather than people||the exchange is `` headed for a real crisis '' if program trading is n't curbed||The first sentence states that the Big Board is overly focused on machines rather than people. The second sentence expands on the potential negative consequences of this focus, suggesting that if program trading (a form of machine-based trading) isn't limited, the exchange will face a real crisis. The second sentence explains what can happen due to the issue raised in the first sentence, thus expanding on the initial point.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations , causing internal contradictions and pitting employee against employee .||At Kidder , a unit of General Electric Co. , and other big brokerage firms , stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away .||The first sentence states that the battle has escalated into a civil war within certain companies and organizations, leading to internal conflicts and disputes among employees. The second sentence provides a specific example of this situation at Kidder, a division of General Electric, and other large brokerage firms, where stockbrokers are in conflict with their own company's program traders working just a few floors away. This example expands on the general idea presented in the first sentence by giving concrete instances of the civil war-like conflicts described.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||At Kidder , a unit of General Electric Co. , and other big brokerage firms , stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away .||Corporations like Contel denounce program trading , yet Contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like Bankers Trust Co. that are also big program traders .||The first sentence explains how stockbrokers at large brokerage firms, such as Kidder (a unit of General Electric Co.), compete with their own firm's program traders. The second sentence introduces another scenario where corporations, like Contel, criticize program trading but have hired pension fund managers, such as Bankers Trust Co., who are also significant program traders. Both situations illustrate the internal conflict or hypocrisy regarding program trading within larger organizations. The second sentence expands on the theme introduced in the first sentence by providing an additional example of this conflict, hence the expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||The Big Board -- the nation 's premier stock exchange -- is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives .||Its entrenched 49 stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs . But the Big Board 's leadership -- over the specialists ' protests -- two weeks ago began trading a new stock `` basket '' product designed to facilitate program trading .||The first sentence states there is a sharp division between the floor traders and top executives at the Big Board. The second sentence details one specific instance of this division, where the stock specialist firms are fighting against certain programs, and the Big Board's leadership initiated a new product to facilitate these programs despite the protests from the specialists. The second sentence expands on the nature of the division mentioned in the first sentence by providing a concrete example of the conflict.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||But the Big Board 's leadership -- over the specialists ' protests -- two weeks ago began trading a new stock `` basket '' product designed to facilitate program trading .||`` A lot of people would like to go back to 1970 , '' before program trading , Mr. Phelan said this week . `` I would like to go back to 1970 . But we are not going back to 1970 . ''||The first sentence discusses the Big Board's leadership initiating a new stock "basket" product amidst protests from specialists, aiming to facilitate program trading. The second sentence features Mr. Phelan expressing a personal wish to return to a time before program trading but acknowledges that such a return is impossible.The Expansion relationship is evident here because Mr. Phelan's comments provide additional context and insight into the situation described in the first sentence. His remarks reflect the broader sentiment surrounding program trading and the resistance to reverting to a pre-program trading era, thereby expanding on the topic introduced in the initial sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||A lot of people would like to go back to 1970 , '' before program trading||`` I would like to go back to 1970 .||In the first sentence, the speaker notes that many people wish they could return to 1970, specifically referencing "before program trading." This suggests a context or reason for desiring to return to that year. The second sentence, "I would like to go back to 1970," aligns with the sentiment expressed in the first sentence and expands on it by including the speaker among those who share the desire to return to 1970. The speaker's personal desire to go back to 1970 is an expansion of the broader sentiment mentioned in the first sentence, indicating agreement or shared feeling.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Again and again , program-trading 's critics raise the `` casino '' theme .||They say greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation 's free-enterprise system , turning the stock market into a big gambling den , with the odds heavily stacked against the small investor .||The first sentence introduces the idea that critics of program trading frequently use the "casino" metaphor to describe it. The second sentence expands on this idea by providing more detail about what the critics mean when they use the "casino" theme. Specifically, it explains that the critics believe greedy market manipulators have turned the stock market into a gambling den where the small investor is at a disadvantage. This additional information serves to elaborate on the initial statement, hence the relationship of expansion.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation 's free-enterprise system , turning the stock market into a big gambling den , with the odds heavily stacked against the small investor||The public did n't come to the market to play a game||The first sentence compares the state of the nation's free-enterprise system to a "big gambling den" due to the actions of market manipulators. The second sentence states that the public did not come to the market to play a game. The comparison is established through the shared theme of the market being likened to a game or gambling scenario. By stating that the public did not come to play a game, the second sentence reinforces the notion that the market has been transformed into something akin to a gambling den, thus comparing the serious nature of investment to the less serious and more risky nature of gambling.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'rather'] ||The public did n't come to the market to play a game||they can go to Off-Track Betting for that||The first sentence states that the public didn't come to the market to play a game, implying they had a different purpose for visiting the market. The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying where people would go if they wanted to play games, suggesting that the market is not the place for such activities. Thus, the second sentence provides additional context to support the initial assertion, explaining that if someone wants to play games, they should go to Off-Track Betting instead. This additional information helps clarify the intended meaning of the first sentence, establishing an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The program traders , on the other hand , portray old-fashioned stock pickers as the Neanderthals of the industry .||Critics like Mr. Murray `` are looking for witches , and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman , '' says J. Thomas Allen , president of Advanced Investment Management Inc. , a Pittsburgh firm that runs a $ 200 million fund that uses index arbitrage .||The first sentence states that program traders view traditional stock pickers as outdated or primitive within the industry. The second sentence expands upon this perspective through the commentary of J. Thomas Allen, who explains how critics (like Mr. Murray) perceive those using computers to trade as scapegoats, reinforcing the idea that there is a contrast between modern trading methods and traditional ones. This further illustrates the viewpoint expressed in the first sentence, hence the expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Critics like Mr. Murray `` are looking for witches , and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman||`` Just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection . ''||The first sentence indicates that critics, like Mr. Murray, are unfairly targeting computer traders. The second sentence explains a potential reason for this behavior: a "blind fear of the unknown." This fear drives them to seek regulatory protection. The contingency relationship is demonstrated by the fact that the action of the critics (targeting computer traders and seeking protection) is contingent upon their fear of the unknown.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||When it occurs , the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market||they lock in the difference in price as profit||The first sentence describes the process traders follow when an arbitrage opportunity arises: they use computers to buy a basket of stocks in one market and sell them in another more expensive market.The second sentence explains the outcome of this process: locking in the difference in price as profit. The profit is contingent upon the successful execution of the described trading strategy. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the occurrence of the event (traders buying and selling stocks) leads to the specific outcome (locking in profit).
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||A program trade of $ 5 million of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of $ 25,000 .||To keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives , traders must seize every opportunity their computers find .||The first sentence indicates the small profit margin for a program trade of a specific value. The second sentence explains what traders need to do to maintain profitability. The relationship is contingent because the necessity for traders to seize opportunities (second sentence) is dependent on the context provided in the first sentence, which highlights the slim profit margins. Essentially, due to the low profits from individual trades, traders must capitalize on all available opportunities to ensure overall profitability.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics profess to despise .||If you continue to do this , the investor becomes frightened -- any investor : the odd lotter , mutual funds and pension funds||The first sentence indicates that there are aspects of program trading that critics dislike, specifically the speed and volatility caused by such trades. The second sentence presents a potential consequence of continuing such practices: it could frighten investors, including various types of investors like odd lot holders, mutual funds, and pension funds. The contingency relationship is established because the fear experienced by investors is contingent upon the continuation of the criticized aspects of program trading. In other words, if the program trading continues in the manner described, then the consequence of frightening investors may follow.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||But many experts and traders say that program trading is n't the main reason for stock-market gyrations .||`` I have not seen one iota of evidence '' to support restrictions on program trading , says a Vanderbilt University finance professor , Hans Stoll , an authority on the subject .||The first sentence states that many experts and traders believe program trading isn't the primary cause of stock-market fluctuations. The second sentence provides a quote from a Vanderbilt University finance professor, Hans Stoll, who is an authority on the subject and supports this viewpoint by saying he has not seen any evidence to justify restrictions on program trading. This quote expands on the initial claim by offering an expert's perspective that aligns with the idea that program trading isn't the main reason for market gyrations.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||`` I have not seen one iota of evidence '' to support restrictions on program trading , says a Vanderbilt University finance professor , Hans Stoll , an authority on the subject .||Says the Big Board 's Mr. Phelan , `` Volatility is greater than program trading . ''||The first sentence presents the viewpoint of Hans Stoll, a Vanderbilt University finance professor and authority on the subject, who asserts that there is no evidence to support restrictions on program trading. The second sentence introduces another perspective from Mr. Phelan of the Big Board, who states that volatility in the market is greater than the impact of program trading. Both sentences present opinions that expand on the topic of program trading and its effects on the market. The relationship is one of expansion because both viewpoints contribute to a broader discussion about the impact of program trading and related market issues.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as'] ||The Oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders , but by news of the unraveling of the $ 6.79 billion buy-out of UAL Corp .||Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares , takeover-stock speculators , or risk arbitragers , dumped every blue-chip stock they had .||The first sentence explains the cause of the Oct. 13 plunge, stating it was due to news about the failed $6.79 billion buy-out of UAL Corp rather than program traders. The second sentence describes the actions of takeover-stock speculators or risk arbitragers who, unable to sell UAL and other airline shares, sold all their blue-chip stocks. The relationship is contingent because the action taken by the speculators (dumping blue-chip stocks) is a direct consequence of the news that triggered the market plunge. The inability to unload specific shares led to a broader selling action, which is contingent upon the initial event described.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares , takeover-stock speculators , or risk arbitragers , dumped every blue-chip stock they had .||While program trades swiftly kicked in , a `` circuit breaker '' that halted trading in stock futures in Chicago made some program trading impossible .||The first sentence describes the actions of takeover-stock speculators who were unable to sell airline shares and thus sold their blue-chip stocks. The second sentence discusses the activation of program trades and the impact of a "circuit breaker" on some program trading. The temporal relationship here can be inferred from the sequence of events: the actions of the speculators occurred before the mention of program trades and the circuit breaker. This suggests that the events in the second sentence follow those in the first, creating a temporal connection.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||critics are ignoring `` the role the takeover stock speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility||Many arbs are `` overleveraged and they `` have to sell when things look like they fall apart . ''||The first sentence states that critics are ignoring the role of the takeover stock speculator as a source of market volatility. The second sentence elaborates on this by describing a specific group (arbs) that is overleveraged and forced to sell during downturns, contributing to volatility. The second sentence expands upon the first by providing more detail about why speculators can cause volatility, specifically through the actions of arbs. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, with the second sentence adding more context and detail to the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Take the traditional money managers , or `` stock pickers , '' as they are derisively known among the computer jockeys .||Traditional stock managers like to charge 50 cents to 75 cents for every $ 100 they manage for big institutional investors , and higher fees for smaller investors .||The first sentence introduces "traditional money managers" and mentions that they are referred to as "stock pickers" in a derogatory manner among computer jockeys. The second sentence provides specific details about the fees these traditional stock managers charge, differentiating between big institutional investors and smaller ones. This detail serves to expand our understanding of the traditional money managers' practices, particularly regarding their fee structures. Therefore, the second sentence expands the information provided in the first one by giving concrete examples of how these managers operate financially.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||Not surprisingly , old-style money managers have been losing clients to giant stock-index funds that use computers to juggle portfolios so they mirror the S&P 500 .||The indexers charge only a few pennies per $ 100 managed .||The first sentence indicates that traditional money managers are losing clients to stock-index funds, which mimic the S&P 500 using computer algorithms. The second sentence provides additional information about these stock-index funds, specifically mentioning that they charge very low fees for their services. This detail helps expand on why the old-style money managers are losing clients, as the lower fees of the stock-index funds would likely be an attractive feature to potential investors. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by offering a specific reason (low cost) for the shift in clientele mentioned in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||These small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of 30 % to 40 % a year on their capital , by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks .||The specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death knell .||The first sentence indicates that the floor brokers earn significant returns due to their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks. The second sentence tells us that these same specialists view moves toward electronic trading as a threat to their livelihood. The contingency relationship is established because the concern over electronic trading (seen as a death knell) is contingent upon the current profitable situation that the specialists enjoy due to their monopoly. In other words, the fear of losing this advantageous position leads to the apprehension about changes in trading methods.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||And they believe the Big Board , under Mr. Phelan , has abandoned their interest .||, Mr. Phelan has nonetheless been striving -- -- to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets .||The first sentence indicates dissatisfaction with the Big Board under Mr. Phelan, suggesting they feel their interests have been abandoned. The second sentence describes Mr. Phelan's efforts to retain index funds and program traders, preventing them from moving to overseas markets. The contingency relationship is evident because Mr. Phelan's actions (striving to keep traders from leaving) are a response to the perceived abandonment of interests, aiming to address the concerns or issues raised in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Meanwhile , specialists ' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility .||`` When the sell programs hit , you can hear the order printers start to go '' on the Big Board trading floor The buyers walk away , and the specialist is left alone '' as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks||The first sentence states that the trading risks for specialists have significantly increased due to stock market volatility. The second sentence provides context for how this situation unfolds: when sell orders come in, the specialists are left as the buyers of last resort because other buyers step back. This explains the contingency relationship: the increased risk faced by specialists (first sentence) is contingent upon the scenario described in the second sentence, where they are left holding stocks due to other buyers withdrawing during volatile market conditions.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||`` When the sell programs hit , you can hear the order printers start to go '' on the Big Board trading floor||The buyers walk away , and the specialist is left alone '' as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks||The first sentence describes a situation where "sell programs" are initiated, leading to audible activity on the trading floor due to order printers. The second sentence then explains a subsequent action taken by the buyers who "walk away," leaving the specialist to act as the buyer of last resort. The temporal relationship is established through the sequence of events: the initiation of sell programs and the resulting printer activity precedes the buyers' decision to withdraw from transactions, leaving the specialist with a specific responsibility.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||No one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation 's stockbrokers .||They are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market crash and the market 's swings since then .||The first sentence states that stockbrokers are particularly unhappy with program trading. The second sentence explains why they might be unhappy: they are attempting to attract small investors who were frightened by the 1987 stock market crash and subsequent market volatility. The reason provided in the second sentence (their efforts to lure back investors) is contingent upon the situation described in the first sentence (their unhappiness with program trading). Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the second sentence provides a justification for the sentiment expressed in the first.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||They are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market crash and the market 's swings since then .||Small investors are absolutely dismayed that Wall Street is stacking the deck against them , and these wide swings are scaring them to death||Both sentences discuss the sentiment of small investors who are fearful of the stock market due to past events. The first sentence mentions that efforts are being made to lure back small investors who were spooked by the 1987 crash and subsequent market swings. The second sentence elaborates on the reasons for their fear, stating that they feel disadvantaged by Wall Street and are terrified by market volatility. By comparing the sentiments and fears of small investors across both sentences, the relationship is one of comparison. Both sentences present a similar viewpoint regarding the investors' feelings toward the stock market, thereby establishing a comparative relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Small investors are absolutely dismayed that Wall Street is stacking the deck against them , and these wide swings are scaring them to death||Stockbrokers ' business and pay has been falling .||The first sentence indicates the state of small investors who are dismayed and scared due to the actions of Wall Street and its effects on the market.The second sentence mentions that stockbrokers' business and pay have been falling. It can be inferred that the downturn in the market, which affects small investors negatively, also impacts stockbrokers, thus creating a contingent relationship where the situation of one group (small investors) influences the situation of another (stockbrokers). The decline in stockbrokers' business and pay is contingent upon the broader market conditions that also cause distress to small investors.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Stockbrokers ' business and pay has been falling .||Last year , the average broker earned $ 71,309 , 24 % lower than in 1987 .||The first sentence states that stockbrokers' business and pay have been declining. The second sentence provides specific details about this decline by mentioning that last year, the average broker earned $71,309, which is 24% less than in 1987. The second sentence expands on the first by offering concrete evidence of the decline in earnings, supporting the claim made in the initial sentence. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||that their company 's stock has been transformed into a nameless piece of a stock-index basket||Index traders who buy all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 often do n't even know what the companies they own actually do||The first sentence states that the company's stock has become generic within a stock index. The second sentence discusses the behavior of index traders who purchase all 500 stocks in the S&P 500, often without knowing details about the companies they own. The contingency relationship is demonstrated because the lack of knowledge about specific companies (second sentence) is contingent upon the stocks being part of a larger index (first sentence). The fact that the stock is just one of many in an index contributes to the likelihood that traders may not be familiar with the specifics of each individual company.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Index traders who buy all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 often do n't even know what the companies they own actually do||`` Do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs ? Oh , you 're in the paper business , '' is one reaction he 's gotten from his big institutional shareholders .||The first sentence states that index traders buying all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 may not know what the companies they own actually do. The second sentence provides a specific example of a reaction from a big institutional shareholder, demonstrating their lack of knowledge about the company's actual business. This example expands on the general idea presented in the first sentence, illustrating how little some shareholders might know about the companies in which they invest. Thus, the second sentence serves to expand the concept introduced in the first one.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||But then came Oct. 13 and the negative publicity orchestrated by the Old Guard , particularly against index arbitrage .||The indexers ' strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die .||The first sentence indicates that there was a specific event (negative publicity on October 13) targeted at index arbitrage, likely affecting those involved in the practice (indexers).The second sentence describes the indexers' current strategy to lay low and wait for the controversy to subside. This strategy is a direct response to the event mentioned in the first sentence, indicating that the indexers' actions are contingent upon the occurrence of the negative publicity.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The indexers ' strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die .||There 's a lynch-mob psychology right now||The first sentence outlines the current strategy of the indexers, which is to wait out the controversy quietly.The second sentence explains the reason for this strategy: there's a lynch-mob psychology at the moment. Thus, the indexer's strategy is contingent upon the current hostile environment. The need to stay quiet and avoid the fury is dependent on the prevailing aggressive public sentiment, hence the contingent relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||There 's a lynch-mob psychology right now||Wall Street 's cash cow has been gored||The first sentence describes a current mentality, likening the situation to a lynch mob.The second sentence introduces an event that could justify such a mentality: Wall Street's primary source of income has been compromised. Here, the contingency relationship is established because the lynch-mob psychology can be seen as a potential reaction to the significant event affecting Wall Street's financial stability. The mentality described in the first sentence is contingent upon the event detailed in the second sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||For example , stock-index futures began trading in Chicago in 1982 , and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched .||Stock futures trading has minted dozens of millionaires in their 20s and 30s .||The first sentence provides information about the rapid growth and success of stock-index futures after they began trading in 1982. The second sentence describes the significant financial impact of stock futures trading, specifically mentioning that it has created many young millionaires. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence expands on the success mentioned in the first sentence by giving a specific outcome (the creation of millionaires) of that success.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Now the stage is set for the battle to play out .||The anti-programmers are getting some helpful thunder from Congress .||The first sentence indicates that the situation is now ready for a conflict or competition to unfold. The second sentence describes support coming from Congress for the anti-programmers. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the assistance from Congress is a contributing factor or condition that influences the unfolding of the battle, suggesting that the help from Congress is contingent upon or will impact the progression of the battle.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The anti-programmers are getting some helpful thunder from Congress .||Program traders ' `` power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way , '' says Rep. Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat .||The first sentence states that the "anti-programmers" are receiving support from Congress. The second sentence provides a specific example of this support through the words of Representative Edward Markey, who criticizes program traders and suggests they should not be allowed to operate unchecked. The second sentence expands on the first by giving a concrete instance of congressional support for the "anti-programmers," hence the expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||Program traders ' `` power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way||`` We have to have a system that says to those largest investors : ` Sit down ! You will not panic , you will not put the financial system in jeopardy . ' ''||The first sentence indicates the significant impact program traders can have, specifically mentioning their ability to create total panic.The second sentence presents a measure taken in response to this situation: implementing a system to control large investors' actions during times of potential panic. The relationship here is one of contingency because the need for such a system (the second sentence) arises from the power of program traders to cause panic (the first sentence). The establishment of the system is contingent upon the recognition of the potential for chaos created by program traders.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||But the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon .||Many people , including the Big Board , think that it 's too late to put the genie back in the bottle .||The first sentence states that the prospects for legislation targeting program trading are unlikely anytime soon. The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining why such legislation is considered unlikely: many people, including the Big Board, believe it's too late to regulate program trading effectively (putting the genie back in the bottle). Thus, the second sentence provides additional context or reasoning that supports the claim made in the first sentence, creating an expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||Many people , including the Big Board , think that it 's too late to put the genie back in the bottle .||The Big Board 's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions , but a total ban is n't being considered||The first sentence indicates that many people, including those at the Big Board, believe it's too late to reverse a situation, symbolically represented as "putting the genie back in the bottle." The second sentence tells us that the Big Board's directors are meeting to approve some program-trading restrictions but are not considering a total ban. The contingency here is that the actions taken by the Big Board (meeting and approving certain restrictions) are influenced by their belief that a complete reversal of the situation is not possible. Their decision not to consider a total ban may be a direct result of this belief, showing how one event (their belief) influences another (their decision).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||You 're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks||Program trading is here to stay , and computers are here to stay , and we just need to understand it . ''||The first part of the sentence, "You 're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks," introduces the concept of trading baskets of stocks, referring to program trading. The latter part of the sentence expands upon this by asserting that program trading and the use of computers in trading are permanent features, and that understanding them is necessary. Thus, the latter part provides additional information and context to support and expand on the initial statement about the permanence and acceptance of program trading.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||One such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement -- -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks .||Currently , margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7 % compared with 50 % for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative .||The first sentence introduces a proposal to increase the margin requirement for stock-index futures to match the level for stocks. The second sentence provides context by comparing the current margin requirements, noting that stock futures have a lower margin requirement than stocks (7% vs. 50%). This comparison highlights the difference in speculation and speed between the two markets due to the differing margin requirements, supporting the rationale for the proposed change. Thus, the second sentence compares the margin requirements for stock futures and stocks, illustrating the basis for the proposal mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||that low margins help keep their markets active||Higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell||The first sentence states that low margins help keep markets active. The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining how higher margins would negatively impact the market: they would drive away smaller traders who assist larger traders in buying and selling. This further clarifies the benefit of low margins mentioned in the first sentence, thus establishing an expansion relationship. The second sentence provides additional detail and context about why low margins are beneficial for market activity.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an `` uptick rule '' .||The Big Board 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price .||The first sentence introduces the concept of a proposed reform for program traders to adhere to an "uptick rule." The second sentence explains what the "uptick rule" means in the context of the Big Board, specifying that it stops the short selling of stocks when their prices are declining. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the meaning of the "uptick rule" mentioned in the first sentence, providing additional details about its function.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||A reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably .||that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the `` pricing efficiency '' of the futures and stock markets||The first sentence states that reinstating the uptick rule for program traders would significantly reduce their activity.The second sentence expresses that such a reinstatement would harm the "pricing efficiency" of futures and stock markets.The contingency here is that the potential negative impact on market efficiency (second sentence) is contingent upon the implementation of the uptick rule (first sentence). In other words, the effect on market efficiency depends on whether the rule is reinstated.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||As usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept : Two separate markets in different locations , trading basically the same widgets , ca n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different .||In index arbitrage , the widget is the S&P 500 , and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in Chicago and the stock markets largely in New York .||The first sentence outlines a general concept where two markets trading the same items cannot sustain large price differences for long. The second sentence then provides a specific example of this concept through index arbitrage, where the S&P 500 is the "widget" and its prices are compared between the futures market in Chicago and the stock markets in New York. Thus, the second sentence expands on the general concept introduced in the first sentence by providing a concrete instance of how this concept works in practice.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||If the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&P 500 index , he is likely to remain fully invested at all times .||Few , if any , index-fund managers will risk leveraging performance by owning more than 100 % exposure to stocks , and equally few will want to own less than a 100 % position should stocks rise .||The first sentence outlines the goal of a money manager who is paid to match or beat the S&P 500 index return. The second sentence describes the actions taken by index-fund managers based on this goal: they typically maintain full exposure to stocks and avoid having less than 100% position in stocks when prices are rising. The actions of the index-fund managers are contingent upon their objective of matching or beating the S&P 500 index, as stated in the first sentence. Their behavior is directly influenced by the goal set forth in the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||By constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget , index-arbitrage traders hope to add between 1 % and 3 % to the annual return of the S&P 500 .||That represents a very thin `` excess '' return , certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective .||The first sentence states that index-arbitrage traders aim to add 1% to 3% to the annual return of the S&P 500 by always trying to own the cheapest widget. The second sentence expands on the idea of the "excess" return, specifying that this 1% to 3% increase is considered very small and much lower than what most fundamental stock pickers aim for as their performance goal. The second sentence provides additional context and detail about the nature of the "excess" return mentioned in the first sentence, thus expanding on the information presented.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||That represents a very thin `` excess '' return , certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective .||The fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the S&P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue .||The first sentence points out that the "excess" return is quite low compared to what most fundamental stock pickers aim for. The second sentence discusses the failure of many fundamentalist money managers to outperform the S&P 500, potentially contributing to heightened emotions around the topic. The failure of these managers to achieve their goals could be seen as evidence supporting the low expectations highlighted in the first sentence. Thus, the second sentence provides a possible reason (or consequence) for the situation described in the first sentence, indicating a contingent relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'since'] ||As more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy , these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and , eventually , eliminated .||The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market .||The first sentence indicates that as more managers use the index-arbitrage strategy, discrepancies between markets will diminish and ultimately vanish. The second sentence explains the reason for the current existence of these discrepancies, pointing out that buying or selling individual stocks within the S&P 500 is more complex compared to trading in the futures market. This explanation suggests that the current state (discrepancies existing due to the complexity of trading individual stocks) leads to the potential change (reduction and elimination of discrepancies as more managers adopt the strategy). Therefore, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, providing the context for why the described outcome in the first sentence can occur.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||An index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in New York and Chicago to cover all transaction costs .||Arbitrage does n't cause volatility||The first sentence explains the condition under which an index-arbitrage trade is executed: only when there is a sufficient difference between the markets to cover transaction costs. The second sentence makes a claim about arbitrage not causing volatility. The contingency relationship is evident because the execution of an arbitrage trade, as described in the first sentence, depends on market conditions (difference between markets). The second sentence provides additional context that may influence how one perceives the impact of arbitrage on market volatility. The relationship is contingent because the decision to execute an arbitrage trade is based on specific market conditions, which are separate from but can be influenced by factors like volatility.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'rather'] ||Arbitrage does n't cause volatility||it responds to it||The first part of the sentence asserts that arbitrage doesn't cause volatility. The second part explains how arbitrage relates to volatility by stating that it responds to it. The second clause expands on the relationship described in the first clause, clarifying that while arbitrage doesn't create volatility, it is a reaction to existing volatility. This expansion deepens our understanding of how arbitrage functions in relation to market volatility.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||it responds to it||Think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&P 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago .||The first sentence makes a general statement suggesting a responsiveness or reaction. The second sentence provides more specific details about what the "it" refers to: the difference in prices between two markets for S&P 500 stocks and the actions of large investors in Chicago. This detailed information expands on the initial statement, explaining the cause of the responsiveness mentioned earlier. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more context and detail about the subject of responsiveness.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||A large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures .||Arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from Chicago to New York , while functioning as a buyer in Chicago .||The first sentence states that a large investor is expected to cause the futures market to decline by selling his futures. The second sentence describes how arbitrage would respond to this situation by transferring the selling pressure and acting as a buyer in Chicago. The relationship is contingent because the action of arbitrage (transferring selling pressure and buying in Chicago) is dependent on the initial action of the large investor selling his futures, which is expected to cause a decline in the market.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||Arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from Chicago to New York , while functioning as a buyer in Chicago .||The start of the whole process is the key - someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move .||The first sentence explains how arbitrage shifts selling pressure from one market (Chicago) to another (New York) while acting as a buyer in the former. The second sentence introduces the concept that a change in widget ownership is necessary to affect widget prices. The contingency relationship is established because the need for someone to fundamentally change their ownership (as described in the second sentence) is what underlies and justifies the actions of arbitrage described in the first sentence. In other words, the action of arbitrage (shifting pressure and buying) is contingent upon the fundamental shift in ownership that initiates price movement.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Why does this large hypothetical seller trade in Chicago instead of New York ?||Perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade .||The first sentence poses a question about why a large hypothetical seller chooses to trade in Chicago instead of New York. The second sentence offers a potential reason for this choice: the seller may be willing to give up some profit for quicker and more certain execution of a large trade. This suggests that the seller's preference for trading in Chicago is contingent upon the benefits of faster and more secure execution, explaining the contingency relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||In a competitive market , this investor has many ways to execute his transactions ,||If not Chicago , then in New York ; .||The first sentence states that in a competitive market, the investor has multiple options for executing transactions.The second sentence offers an alternative location (New York) if the initial one (Chicago) is not chosen. This shows that the choice of where to execute transactions is dependent on whether Chicago is selected or not, establishing a contingency relationship between the two sentences. Specifically, the availability of alternatives (New York) hinges on the decision regarding the primary option (Chicago).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||If not Chicago , then in New York ;||if not the U.S. , then overseas .||The first part of the sentence presents a choice between two locations for some unspecified event: Chicago or New York. The second part of the sentence broadens the scope of potential locations beyond the initial choice: if not within the U.S. (which includes both Chicago and New York), then overseas. This second part expands the range of possibilities from the specific cities mentioned to a global scale. Therefore, the relationship between the two parts of the sentence is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||Volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage , but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity .||Eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising , creating more volatility instead of less .||The first sentence explains that volatility around the trades happens due to the significant impact on the widget market rather than index arbitrage. The second sentence discusses the hypothetical scenario of eliminating arbitrage and its effect on liquidity and volatility. The contingency relationship is evident because the second sentence presents a consequence (decline in liquidity and increased volatility) that would occur if a specific condition (eliminating arbitrage) were met. This consequence is directly related to the reason for volatility mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising , creating more volatility instead of less .||The speed of his transaction is n't to be feared either , because faster and cleaner execution is desirable , not loathsome .||The first sentence discusses the potential negative effects of eliminating arbitrage, specifically that liquidity will decline and volatility will increase. The second sentence further supports the idea that there are no additional fears to be had regarding the speed of transactions, suggesting that faster and cleaner execution is actually desirable. This expands on the overall theme of the potential negative outcomes from altering market conditions, emphasizing that there are no other aspects to fear, particularly concerning the speed of transactions. The expansion relationship is established by adding more detail and support to the idea that changes in the market may not produce the intended positive results.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||because faster and cleaner execution is desirable , not loathsome||If slowing things down could reduce volatility , stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future .||The first sentence states that faster and cleaner execution is desirable, not loathsome. The second sentence expands on this idea by using a hyperbolic example: if slowing things down (as opposed to faster execution) could reduce volatility, then stone tablets (an extremely slow method of recording trades) should become the trade ticket of the future. This expansion clarifies the original point by emphasizing just how undesirable slower execution is, even suggesting an absurdly slow alternative to highlight the value of speed and cleanliness in execution.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||We must be very cautious about labeling investors as `` long-term '' or `` short-term . ''||Policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the Big Board 's door saying : `` Buyers welcome , sellers please go away ! ''||The first sentence expresses caution about labeling investors based on their investment duration. The second sentence presents a policy scenario that favors one type of investor over another. The relationship is contingent because the policy described in the second sentence can be seen as a consequence or an example of what happens when we do not follow the advice given in the first sentence (i.e., not being cautious about labeling investors). The policy acts as a potential outcome of failing to heed the warning, making the second sentence contingent upon the first.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the Big Board 's door saying : `` Buyers welcome , sellers please go away ! ''||The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive||The first sentence criticizes policies that favor certain types of investors over others by comparing them to a sign that welcomes buyers but sends away sellers. The second sentence states that the ultimate goal of any investor is to make a profit. While the two sentences do not directly compare each other, they share a common theme of investor behavior and motives. The comparison lies in how both sentences relate to the context of investing: the first through a critical analogy of selective investment policies, and the second by stating a general truth about investor goals. Thus, they are connected through a thematic comparison around the concept of investing.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term .||A free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate .||The first sentence states that regulators should not worry about whether investors focus enough on the long term.The second sentence describes a situation where a free market with a profit motive naturally guides investors toward investments they find suitable. The contingency relationship is demonstrated because the second sentence provides a justification for the first: the suggestion that regulators needn't worry is contingent upon the belief that the free market will appropriately manage investor behavior through its own mechanisms.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||In point of fact , volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today .||Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile , .||The first sentence states that the volatility, measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements, has often been higher than it is today. The second sentence provides additional context by specifying a particular period (before the advent of futures or program trading) when volatility was often higher. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by giving a specific example of when volatility was particularly high.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile , usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change 1973-75 , 1937-40 , and 1928-33 for example .||It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream `` foul '' on program trading when the markets decline , while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise .||The first sentence provides historical context, suggesting that periods without futures or program trading experienced volatility, especially during changes in fundamental market conditions.The second sentence critiques the behavior of "fundamental stock pickers" who blame program trading for market declines but praise the market when it rises. This implies a contingent relationship where the reactions of stock pickers depend on market conditions (as described in the first sentence). The criticism in the second sentence is contingent upon the historical observation in the first sentence, suggesting that the current complaints may be overlooking past volatility trends.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream `` foul '' on program trading when the markets decline , while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise .||Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks , instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?||The first sentence highlights the contrasting reactions of fundamental stock pickers to market fluctuations: they complain about program trading when the market declines but praise the market when it rises. The second sentence proposes an alternative explanation for market volatility, suggesting it could be due to economic uncertainties rather than program trading.The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the stock pickers' selective criticism of program trading with an alternative viewpoint that attributes volatility to broader economic factors. This comparison implies that the stock pickers' reactions may not fully capture the complexities of market dynamics.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled `` program-trading volatility '' could be far worse than the perceived problem .||In using program trading as a whipping boy , fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stock-selection products . They may , however , risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves .||The first sentence states that some proposed solutions to "program-trading volatility" could actually be worse than the problem itself. The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining how fundamentalist investors, who blame program trading, might benefit by attracting small investors to their stock-selection products but also risk unwanted intervention from external sources. This intervention could be one of the "far worse" consequences mentioned in the first sentence, thus expanding on the potential negative outcomes of addressing the issue improperly.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||They may , however , risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves .||How does a nice new tax , say 5 % , on any financial transaction sound ?||The first sentence suggests there's a risk involved with some form of external interference in the markets.The second sentence proposes a specific example of such interference: a new 5% tax on financial transactions. The proposal expands on what kind of interference is being considered, providing a concrete example of the risk mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the second sentence expands the idea introduced in the first one by giving a detailed instance of potential interference.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||This argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading -- not because of its merits , but because of the firms championing the cause .||The loudest of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors .||The first sentence indicates that the most interesting argument for abolishing program trading is noteworthy due to the firms supporting it, not because of the argument's own strength. The second sentence identifies who these reformers are: money managers serving smaller investors. The second sentence expands on the first by specifying the type of firms that are championing the cause, providing additional detail about the entities mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||They continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell , while their clients continue to hope for superior performance .||Even with mutual funds , the little investor continues to tolerate high fees , high commissions and poor performance , while index-fund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees , lower commissions and less risk .||The first sentence describes the ongoing activity of financial advisors giving advice to their clients about buying or selling individual stocks, and clients hoping for good results from those recommendations. The second sentence expands on this theme by discussing another context where investors face similar issues but with mutual funds. It introduces additional information about the challenges faced by small investors, including high fees, commissions, and poor performance, contrasting this with the benefits of index fund management. This relationship shows an expansion of the initial concept into a related area, focusing on mutual funds rather than individual stocks but maintaining the theme of investment advice and client expectations.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'but'] ||If spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous , surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors .||The sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue stellar performers first , while leaving institutions to grapple with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter .||The first sentence suggests that the spreads available through index arbitrage are significant enough for mutual fund companies to offer them to small investors.The second sentence discusses the tendency of retail investors to seek high-performing investments, contrasting with institutional investors who focus on smaller gains over time. These two sentences establish a comparison between the potential for small investors to benefit from index arbitrage and the actual investment behavior of retail investors, who often overlook such opportunities in favor of chasing higher returns. The comparison highlights the difference in investment strategies between retail and institutional investors.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||The sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue stellar performers first , while leaving institutions to grapple with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter .||Cost-effective index funds just are n't sexy enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay , and that institutional customers refuse to pay .||The first sentence highlights the behavior of retail investors and the challenge faced by institutions in managing large sums of money with a focus on small performance gains. The second sentence explains a reason for this behavior: cost-effective index funds lack the allure to justify the higher fees and commissions typically associated with retail customer services, which institutional customers refuse to pay. The relationship is contingent because the second sentence provides a rationale for why retail investors behave as described in the first sentence and why institutions face certain challenges. The fees and commissions that retail customers often pay, and institutional customers avoid, provide context for the situation described.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Each new trading roadblock is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their high-volume clients , here or overseas .||Legislating new trading inefficiencies will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors .||The first sentence indicates that any new trading roadblocks will likely be overcome by institutions aiming to better serve their high-volume clients. The second sentence discusses the impact of legislating new trading inefficiencies, specifically how they will make things more difficult for less sophisticated investors. The relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, as the action taken by institutions to overcome roadblocks (implied in the first sentence) is contingent upon the creation of new trading inefficiencies (stated in the second sentence). In other words, the necessity for institutions to find solutions (first sentence) depends on the occurrence of new inefficiencies (second sentence), particularly those that affect less sophisticated investors.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||So what is next for program trading ?||Left to its own devices , index arbitrage will become more and more efficient , making it harder and harder to do profitably .||The first sentence questions the future of program trading, specifically index arbitrage. The second sentence expands on this by describing what would happen if left unchecked: it would become increasingly efficient and difficult to profit from. The expansion comes from providing a detailed scenario about the progression and challenges of index arbitrage, directly addressing "what is next" for the practice.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Left to its own devices , index arbitrage will become more and more efficient , making it harder and harder to do profitably .||Spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor chooses -- arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit .||The first sentence states that if left unchecked, index arbitrage will grow increasingly efficient, making profitable participation more difficult. The second sentence elaborates on this point by describing the outcome of this increasing efficiency: spreads will tighten to the point where no temporary profit can be gained regardless of the market chosen. This second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by providing a specific consequence of the growing efficiency in index arbitrage.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending , Congress cut by $ 30 million the Bush administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 , which began Oct. 1 .||To offset the reduction , Congress approved a $ 20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers , acquisitions and certain other transactions .||The first sentence indicates that Congress reduced funding for antitrust enforcement as part of broader spending cuts. The second sentence introduces a new measure: a fee to offset the reduction. The comparison relationship here can be understood through the context that both actions (cutting funds and introducing a fee) are responses to the same issue (reducing spending). They are presented as alternative approaches to managing the budget for antitrust enforcement. Thus, the relationship is one of comparison, as both sentences describe different strategies taken by Congress to address the same financial goal.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them||It could operate to augment our budget||The first sentence indicates that there's an expectation for filing fees to offset budget reductions and potentially surpass them. The second sentence introduces the idea of the fees having the potential to increase the overall budget. The relationship of expansion is demonstrated here because the concept of the filing fees not only compensating for reductions but also adding to the budget builds upon and expands the initial idea presented in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Under measures approved by both houses of Congress , the administration 's request for $ 47 million for the Antitrust Division would be cut $ 15 million .||The FTC budget request of $ 70 million , about $ 34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement , would also be cut by $ 15 million .||The first sentence states that the administration's request for $47 million for the Antitrust Division would be cut by $15 million. The second sentence provides more details about budget cuts, specifying that the FTC's budget request, including funds for antitrust enforcement, would also face a $15 million cut. The second sentence expands on the theme of budget cuts introduced in the first sentence by providing additional information about another affected area (FTC budget, specifically detailing the antitrust enforcement portion). Thus, the second sentence serves to expand the context and detail regarding budget cuts mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The FTC budget request of $ 70 million , about $ 34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement , would also be cut by $ 15 million .||The administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as was appropriated in fiscal 1989 .||The first sentence outlines the FTC's budget request and mentions that part of it is allocated for antitrust enforcement, along with a planned reduction. The second sentence provides additional context by specifying that the requested amount for antitrust enforcement in fiscal 1990 is similar to what was appropriated in the previous year, fiscal 1989. This additional information expands on the details of the budget request mentioned in the first sentence, particularly concerning the antitrust enforcement funding. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds more detail to the information presented in the first.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||that , based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year , the fees will yield at least $ 40 million this fiscal year , or $ 10 million more than the budget cuts||When you do that , there is not a cut , but there is in fact a program increase of $ 5 million '' each for the FTC and the Justice Department||The first sentence outlines the expectation of generating at least $40 million from fees based on recent filing levels, which is $10 million more than the budget cuts. The second sentence explains how this additional revenue leads to an increase of $5 million each for the FTC and the Justice Department, effectively turning what could be perceived as a cut into an increase. Thus, the second sentence is contingent on the first, as the program increase depends on the revenue generated from the fees exceeding the budget cuts.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'previously'] ||But Rep. Don Edwards D. , Calif . responded that a recession could stifle merger activity , reducing the amount of fees collected .||The antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department were cut more than 40 % in the Reagan administration , and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period .||The first sentence describes Rep. Don Edwards' response regarding the potential impact of a recession on merger activity and subsequent fee collection. The second sentence provides information about cuts to the antitrust staffs and a decline in major merger case enforcement during the Reagan administration. The temporal relationship here can be inferred because the context suggests that Rep. Edwards' comments are likely in reference to a current or future situation, while the cuts and changes in enforcement mentioned in the second sentence occurred in the past (during the Reagan administration). Therefore, the second event (the cuts and decrease in enforcement) happened before the first event (Rep. Edwards' response), indicating a temporal sequence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as'] ||But the 1989 fall total of 80 , while well below 1988 activity , shows `` a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives||the 10 citizen-sparked issues on state ballots this fall represent the most in any odd-year this decade||The first sentence notes a trend of increasing citizen-led referenda and initiatives, despite the 1989 figure being lower than 1988. The second sentence provides specific evidence of this trend, mentioning that there are 10 citizen-sparked issues on state ballots, the most for any odd year in the decade. The second sentence provides additional supporting detail for the claim made in the first sentence. Thus, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, offering concrete data to support the observation about the increase in citizen-led actions.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||attention already is focused on the 1990 elections||In California , two petition drives for next year 's election are `` essentially finished||The first sentence states that attention is already on the 1990 elections. The second sentence expands on this idea by providing specific examples from California where two petition drives for next year's election are essentially finished. This shows more detail about what aspects of the 1990 elections have garnered attention, specifically the progress of petition drives in California.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||In California , two petition drives for next year 's election are `` essentially finished||Mr. McGuigan cites three completed efforts in Oklahoma .||The first sentence discusses petition drives in California that are essentially finished for next year's election. The second sentence introduces a related but distinct piece of information: Mr. McGuigan mentioning three completed efforts in Oklahoma. The expansion relationship is demonstrated through the addition of more examples (the Oklahoma efforts) to the topic introduced in the first sentence (completed petition drives). This additional information broadens the scope of the discussion beyond California to include another state with similar activities.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Price records are being set at auctions this week .||At Christie 's , a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz 's `` Equivalents '' series sold for $ 396,000 , a single-lot record .||The first sentence states that price records are being set at auctions during the week. The second sentence provides a specific example of a record being set: a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz's "Equivalents" series sold for $396,000 at Christie's, setting a single-lot record. This detailed information expands on the initial statement about records being set, giving a concrete instance of what the first sentence refers to.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'previously'] ||In part , prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints .||This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal||The first sentence discusses how prices reflect the development of a market structure based on certain variables, including the number of prints. The second sentence talks about the past state of the information, which used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal. The temporal relationship here indicates a sequence of events: first, the market structure developed and prices reflected certain variables; then, the information about this market structure and its variables improved over time, moving from being poorly documented and largely anecdotal to a presumably more reliable and well-documented state. Thus, the second sentence describes a change over time that follows the situation described in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal||There is finally some sort of sense in the market||The first sentence indicates that there was a lack of reliable data due to poor documentation and anecdotal evidence. The second sentence introduces a change in the situation, stating that there is now some sense in the market. The contingency relationship is established because the emergence of sense in the market appears to be dependent on or a response to the previous lack of reliable information. The change in the market's condition is contingent upon the improvement in the quality and availability of information.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||giving greater market stability||`` When I see prints going into the hands of institutions , I know they are n't going to come back on the market . ''||The first sentence describes an outcome, which is greater market stability. The second sentence contains a quote explaining a situation where prints are acquired by institutions and will likely not return to the market. This situation contributes to the outcome of greater market stability, as fewer items on the market can lead to increased stability. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the occurrence of the situation described in the second sentence (prints not returning to the market) leads to the outcome stated in the first sentence (greater market stability).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||I 'm starting to see more business transactions||Colleges are eyeing registration through 900 service .||The first sentence indicates the speaker is observing an increase in business transactions, suggesting a broader trend or growth in a specific area. The second sentence presents a specific instance of this trend: colleges considering 900 services for registration. This detail expands upon the initial statement by providing an example of the type of business transactions increasing, thus deepening our understanding of the context and scope of the growing trend mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||Colleges are eyeing registration through 900 service .||Charities test the waters , but they face legal barriers to electronic fund raising .||The first sentence discusses colleges considering using a 900 service for registration. The second sentence introduces a related concept: charities exploring electronic fundraising, albeit facing legal challenges. Both sentences talk about different institutions (colleges and charities) considering adopting new technologies for registration or fundraising, respectively. The use of "eyeing" and "test the waters" indicates exploratory actions taken by both groups, suggesting an expansion of the idea from educational institutions to charitable organizations. Thus, the relationship is one of expansion, where the theme of institutions considering technological solutions for administrative processes is broadened to include charities.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||but they face legal barriers to electronic fund raising .||The thing that will really break this market right open is merchandising||The first sentence indicates there are legal barriers to electronic fundraising for some entities. The second sentence introduces the idea that merchandising could significantly impact the market. The relationship here is contingent because the potential success or opening up of the market through merchandising is presented as a factor that could circumvent or overshadow the existing legal barriers mentioned in the first sentence. The success of merchandising is suggested as a contingent factor that could change the situation regarding electronic fundraising.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||FAMILY PETS are improving recovery rates of patients at Columbia Hospital , Milwaukee .||Patients who receive canine or feline visitors are found to have lower blood pressure and improved appetite and be more receptive to therapy||The first sentence states that family pets are improving recovery rates for patients at Columbia Hospital in Milwaukee. The second sentence provides specific details about how these patients benefit from visits by canines or felines, including lower blood pressure, improved appetite, and increased receptiveness to therapy. These benefits are contingent upon the presence of the family pets, suggesting that the positive outcomes for patients depend on their interaction with the animals. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the effects (improved health markers) are contingent upon the cause (visits from family pets).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||that eliminates the need to string lights||The $ 6,500 tree is designed to send continuously changing colored light to dozens of fiber-end bunches .||The first sentence states the benefit of not needing to string lights. The second sentence provides additional detail about how the tree achieves this benefit: it sends continuously changing colored light to dozens of fiber-end bunches. The second sentence expands on the idea presented in the first sentence by explaining the mechanism that makes stringing lights unnecessary. Therefore, the relationship between these two sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Growth of Japanese trade and travel prompts Beth Israel Medical Center , New York , to set up a bilingual medical practice||Funded by a $ 1 million gift from Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance , the service will follow Japanese medical protocols , including emphasis on preventative medicine .||The first sentence states that due to the growth of Japanese trade and travel, Beth Israel Medical Center has decided to establish a bilingual medical practice. The second sentence details how this practice will be funded and what services it will offer. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence expands on the first by providing additional information about the funding source ($1 million gift from Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance) and the specifics of the service (following Japanese medical protocols, focusing on preventative medicine). This further explains and elaborates on the initial statement about setting up the bilingual medical practice.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||, parents are returning to the cloth diaper .||business is up 35 % in the past year||The first sentence indicates a trend where parents are going back to using cloth diapers. The second sentence reports an increase in business related presumably to cloth diapers by 35% over the past year. The increase in business can be seen as a consequence or result of parents returning to cloth diapers. Thus, the rise in business is contingent upon the shift in consumer behavior towards using cloth diapers again.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||business is up 35 % in the past year||We 're gaining 1,200 new customers each week||The first sentence states that the business has increased by 35% over the past year.The second sentence provides additional context for this growth, stating that the business gains 1,200 new customers each week. This information explains how the business has been able to grow by 35%, thus the relationship between the two sentences is expansion. The increase in new customers each week supports and expands upon the initial statement about business growth.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||that since January it has gotten more than 672 inquiries from people interested in starting diaper services||Elisa Hollis launched a diaper service last year because State College , Pa. , where she lives , did n't have one .||The first sentence states that there has been a significant interest in starting diaper services since January, with over 672 inquiries received. The second sentence provides a specific example of this trend by mentioning Elisa Hollis, who launched a diaper service due to the lack of such a service in her town, State College, Pa. This particular instance supports and expands upon the general statement in the first sentence, illustrating how the high level of interest translates into actual action taken by individuals like Elisa Hollis. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information provided in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Elisa Hollis launched a diaper service last year because State College , Pa. , where she lives , did n't have one .||Diaper shortages this summer limited growth at Stork Diaper Services , Springfield , Mass. , where business is up 25 % in||In the first sentence, we learn that Elisa Hollis started a diaper service due to the absence of such a service in her town. This demonstrates the creation of a new service to meet a need.The second sentence talks about Stork Diaper Services experiencing growth but being limited by diaper shortages. This shows the expansion of an existing similar service facing different challenges.The Expansion relationship indicates that the second sentence presents a broader context or a related situation that expands upon the theme of diaper services, illustrating how another business in the same industry is faring.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor||that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades , that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading||The speaker expresses an opinion that program trading is unfair to the individual investor. The following sentence lists specific reasons for this opinion: program traders have lower commission costs due to trade volume, they have more favorable margin requirements, and they can predict market movements sooner. The detailed reasons provided support and explain the speaker's initial opinion, indicating a contingent relationship. The speaker's opinion is contingent upon the detailed justifications given.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||the market overvalued the troubles in junk bonds .||The market may be giving us another message , that a recession is looming||The first sentence states that the market overvalued the troubles in junk bonds, suggesting a specific situation or perspective on market behavior.The second sentence presents a possible interpretation or implication of this situation, suggesting that the market might be signaling an upcoming recession. Here, the idea of a looming recession is contingent upon the market's overvaluation of junk bond troubles, indicating that one event (overvaluation) leads to the consideration of another (recession). The relationship is contingent because the second sentence proposes a potential consequence or insight derived from the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||that `` program trading creates deviant swings||It 's not a sound thing||The first sentence states that "program trading creates deviant swings," suggesting there's an issue with program trading leading to abnormal market movements. The second sentence, "It's not a sound thing," further elaborates on the negative implications of the situation by indicating that program trading isn't reliable or stable. The second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by providing an evaluation of program trading's reliability, thus deepening the discussion of its problematic nature.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||It 's not a sound thing||there 's no inherent virtue in it||The first part of the sentence, "It's not a sound thing," suggests that whatever is being discussed is not solid or reliable. The second part, "there's no inherent virtue in it," further clarifies why it's unsound - because it lacks any intrinsic worth or merit. The second part of the sentence expands upon the idea introduced in the first part by providing a specific reason for why the subject is not sound. Therefore, the relationship between the two parts is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||there 's no inherent virtue in it||that legislation curbing it would be `` a darned good idea||The first sentence states there is no inherent virtue in something unspecified but implied to be negative or controversial. The second sentence suggests that legislation to curb this unspecified thing would be a good idea. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the suggestion for legislative action (curbing it) based on the premise that there is no inherent virtue in it. The idea of legislation is contingent upon the belief that the subject lacks merit or positive qualities.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||At the Charles Schwab & Co. office in Atlanta 's Buckhead district , a group of investors voices skepticism that federal officials would curb program trading .||Citing the October 1987 crash , Glenn Miller says , `` It 's like the last crash -- they threatened , but no one did anything . ''||The first sentence presents a scenario where a group of investors at the Charles Schwab & Co. office in Atlanta's Buckhead district expresses skepticism about federal officials curbing program trading. The second sentence provides an example of why they are skeptical, with Glenn Miller referring to the events following the October 1987 crash, where similar threats were made but no action was taken. This second sentence expands on the skepticism mentioned in the first sentence by giving a historical context for their doubts.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Citing the October 1987 crash , Glenn Miller says , `` It 's like the last crash -- they threatened , but no one did anything . ''||A. Donald Anderson , a 59-year-old Los Angeles investor who says the stock market 's `` fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie-jeebies , '' does n't see much point in outlawing program trading .||In the first sentence, Glenn Miller references the October 1987 crash and notes that there were threats but no action taken. In the second sentence, A. Donald Anderson, another individual, shares his feelings about the stock market's fluctuations and his opinion on program trading. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence introduces a related perspective from another person, further developing the theme of individuals' reactions to stock market events and their views on measures such as program trading. Both Miller and Anderson express skepticism or discomfort with aspects of the stock market, contributing to a broader discussion on market volatility and regulation.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||A. Donald Anderson , a 59-year-old Los Angeles investor who says the stock market 's `` fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie-jeebies , '' does n't see much point in outlawing program trading .||Those who still want to do it `` will just find some way to get around '' any attempt to curb it .||In the first sentence, Donald Anderson expresses discomfort with the stock market's fluctuations and gyrations but also shows a lack of support for outlawing program trading. The second sentence explains his belief that those wanting to engage in program trading will find ways to circumvent any restrictions. The contingency relationship is established because Anderson's perspective on the futility of banning program trading (second sentence) is contingent upon his views on the stock market's volatility and the likely behavior of traders (first sentence). Essentially, his stance on not outlawing program trading is based on his belief that people will bypass regulations anyway.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Yet he is n't in favor of new legislation .||I think we 've got enough securities laws||The first sentence states that the person is not in favor of new legislation.The second sentence provides a reason for this stance: the speaker believes there are already enough securities laws. Thus, the reason ("I think we've got enough securities laws") explains why the person is not in favor of new legislation, establishing a contingent relationship between the two sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||I think we 've got enough securities laws||`` I 'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit . ''||In the first sentence, the speaker expresses their belief that there are sufficient securities laws.In the second sentence, the speaker indicates their preference for focusing on different issues, specifically interest rates and the deficit. The relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion because the second sentence provides additional context or information regarding what the speaker would prefer to see addressed instead of more securities laws. This further clarifies the speaker's stance on the topic at hand.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||but he also is n't sure it should be more strictly regulated .||I do n't want to denounce it because denouncing it would be like denouncing capitalism||In the first sentence, the speaker expresses uncertainty about whether the subject should be more strictly regulated.In the second sentence, the speaker explains why they do not want to denounce it: doing so would be akin to denouncing capitalism. This provides additional context and reasoning for the speaker's uncertainty expressed in the first sentence, thus expanding on the initial idea.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||that program trading `` increases liquidity in the market||You ca n't hold back technology . ''||The first sentence states that program trading increases liquidity in the market. The second sentence, "You can't hold back technology," is a general statement that supports or expands upon the idea that technological advancements, like program trading, are inevitable and beneficial. Here, the assertion that one cannot hold back technology implies that program trading, as a form of technological advancement, is here to stay and contributes positively to the market. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by reinforcing the positive impact of technology (in this case, program trading) in the market.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||that program trading `` increases volatility , but I do n't think it should be banned||There 's no culprit here .||The first sentence presents a viewpoint on program trading, suggesting that while it increases volatility, the speaker does not believe it should be banned. The second sentence introduces the idea that there is no culprit, implying no single entity or factor is to blame for market issues. The contingency relationship exists because the speaker's opinion on not banning program trading (despite acknowledging its negative effects) is contingent upon the belief that there is no single culprit responsible for market problems. The speaker's stance on banning program trading is influenced by the absence of a singular blame-worthy factor.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'rather'] ||There 's no culprit here .||The market is just becoming more efficient . ''||The first sentence states there is no culprit, suggesting no one person or entity is to blame for a certain situation. The second sentence provides additional context or elaborates on the situation by explaining that the market is simply becoming more efficient. This explanation expands upon the idea introduced in the first sentence by offering a reason for why there might not be a culprit: the changes are due to natural market evolution rather than any individual's actions.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The market is just becoming more efficient . ''||Arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets||The first sentence states that the market is becoming more efficient.The second sentence expands on this idea by providing additional information about how arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices contributes to the efficiency of financial markets. Thus, the second sentence serves to expand on the concept of market efficiency introduced in the first sentence, explaining one way in which markets can become more efficient.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'although'] ||Arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets||that his shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual fund , and volatility , on a given day , may hurt the fund||The first sentence discusses the concept of arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices in financial markets. The second sentence introduces a scenario where someone's shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual fund, which can be affected by volatility on any given day.Both sentences describe situations involving financial investments and the potential impact of market fluctuations. The relationship between the sentences is comparative because they both deal with the theme of how market conditions (like price differences and volatility) can affect investments (like arbitrage opportunities and mutual fund values).
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||But `` I 'm a long-term investor , '' .||`` If you were a short-term investor , you might be more leery about program trading . ''||The first sentence establishes the speaker's position as a "long-term investor." The second sentence discusses the perspective of a "short-term investor" and how they might feel differently about program trading. These two sentences form a comparison by contrasting the attitudes of long-term and short-term investors toward program trading. The contrast highlights different viewpoints based on investment time horizons, thereby creating a comparative relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||that it can bring the market back up after a plunge||If we have a real bad day , the program would say , ` Buy||The first sentence states the capability of something (presumably a program or mechanism) to bring the market back up after a plunge.The second sentence presents a scenario where this capability is put into use, specifically on a day when the market has a "real bad day".This indicates that the action of the program buying (as described in the second sentence) is contingent upon a specific condition (a bad day in the market). Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, with the action taken being dependent on the occurrence of a particular situation.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||If we have a real bad day , the program would say , ` Buy||`` If you could get the rhythm of the program trading , you could take advantage of it . ''||The first sentence presents a hypothetical scenario where the program would suggest "Buy" if there's a really bad day. The second sentence offers advice on how one could potentially benefit from understanding the pattern of program trading. The contingency relationship is established because the advice given in the second sentence is contingent upon the behavior of the program as described in the first sentence. Specifically, being able to predict when the program will suggest "Buy" (especially during a bad day) allows one to take advantage of its trading rhythm.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Scott Taccetta , a Chicago accountant , is going into money-market funds .||he had just recouped the $ 5,000 he lost in the 1987 crash when he lost more money last Oct. 13||The first sentence states that Scott Taccetta, a Chicago accountant, is going into money-market funds.The second sentence gives information about his financial experiences: he recovered losses from the 1987 crash but then lost more money on October 13th. This context implies that his decision to invest in money-market funds may be influenced by his past financial experiences, particularly the losses and recovery mentioned. Therefore, the relationship is one of contingency, where his investment decision is contingent upon his prior financial experiences.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||Mr. Taccetta says he had just recouped the $ 5,000 he lost in the 1987 crash when he lost more money last Oct. 13 .||Now , he plans to sell all his stocks by the first quarter of 1990 .||The first sentence indicates that Mr. Taccetta experienced financial losses in the stock market both in 1987 and again on October 13th of an unspecified recent year, having only just recovered the initial loss before the subsequent setback. The second sentence details his plan to sell all his stocks by the first quarter of 1990. This plan is contingent upon his recent experiences with financial losses, suggesting that the decision to sell his stocks is a direct result of the losses he has endured.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||In October , before the market dropped , Mrs. Arighi of Arnold , Calif. , moved to sell the `` speculative stocks '' in her family trust `` so we will be able to withstand all this flim-flammery '' caused by program trading .||that the only answer for individuals is to `` buy stocks that 'll weather any storm||The first sentence indicates that Mrs. Arighi decided to sell speculative stocks in anticipation of market instability, referencing "flim-flammery" caused by program trading. The second sentence suggests a strategy for individuals to cope with market volatility by purchasing stable stocks. The contingency relationship is evident because Mrs. Arighi's action (selling speculative stocks) is presented as a response to the perceived risks of market fluctuations. Her decision to sell those stocks can be seen as an application of the broader advice provided in the second sentence, which recommends buying stocks that can withstand market storms. Thus, the second sentence provides context for understanding Mrs. Arighi's decision, showing how her actions were contingent upon her assessment of market conditions and the need for stability.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Lucille Gorman , an 84-year-old Chicago housewife , has become amazingly immune to stock-market jolts .||Mrs. Gorman took advantage of low prices after the 1987 crash to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the Oct. 13 plunge .||The first sentence states that Lucille Gorman, an 84-year-old Chicago housewife, has become remarkably immune to stock-market jolts. The second sentence provides specific examples of how she demonstrated this immunity: by taking advantage of low prices after the 1987 crash to buy stocks and hunting for other bargains following the October 13 plunge. The second sentence expands on the first by offering concrete instances of her behavior in the stock market, thereby providing more detail and context to support the claim that she is immune to stock-market jolts.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||My stocks are all blue chips||`` If the market goes down , I figure it 's paper profits I 'm losing .||The first sentence indicates that the speaker owns blue-chip stocks, which are generally considered stable and reliable.The second sentence presents a conditional scenario: if the market goes down, the speaker considers the losses to be only on paper. This shows that the speaker's perspective on potential losses (the contingency) is influenced by the nature of their stock holdings (blue-chip stocks). The relationship is contingent because the speaker's attitude towards potential losses is based on the type of stocks they own.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||`` If the market goes down , I figure it 's paper profits I 'm losing . On the other hand , if it goes way sky high , I always sell .||You do n't want to get yourself too upset about these things .||In the first sentence, the speaker discusses their strategy for handling fluctuations in the market: they consider losses as "paper profits" when the market goes down and sell when the market rises significantly. In the second sentence, the speaker advises against getting too upset over market changes. This advice expands on the mindset described in the first sentence, suggesting a broader approach to maintaining emotional balance when dealing with market volatility. The second sentence provides additional insight into the speaker's attitude towards managing stress related to investments, thus expanding on the initial idea presented.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||they created small changes in the crystal-lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to 600,000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field||they made the advance with yttrium-containing superconductors cooled to liquid-nitrogen temperature , or minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit||The first sentence outlines the achievement of increasing the current carried by single crystals to 600,000 amps per square centimeter through small changes in the crystal-lattice structures of superconductors. The second sentence provides additional details about the conditions under which this advance was made, specifying that it involved yttrium-containing superconductors cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. Therefore, the second sentence expands upon the first by giving more context and specifics about the type of superconductors and the cooling conditions used to achieve the result, deepening our understanding of the initial statement.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'previously'] ||The finding marks a significant step in research on `` bulk '' superconductors , which are aimed at use in wires for motors , magnets , generators and other applications .||Scientists had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors , but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry .||The first sentence states that there has been a significant step in research on "bulk" superconductors for various applications. The second sentence then explains previous work where scientists achieved high current-carrying capacities in thin films but faced challenges with bulk crystals.The temporal relationship is established by the sequence of events: the initial research (achieving results with thin films and encountering issues with bulk crystals) came before the significant step mentioned in the first sentence. This sequence indicates that the research described in the first sentence likely followed the earlier work detailed in the second sentence, thus placing the events in a temporal order.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||But `` it wo n't lead to imminent use '' of new superconductors||that the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals||The first sentence states that the development will not lead to the immediate use of new superconductors.The second sentence explains why this is the case: the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples remains too low due to weak links between crystals. The reason provided in the second sentence (low current-carrying capacity and weak links) justifies the statement in the first sentence (imminent use will not happen). Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the second sentence explains the condition that prevents the outcome described in the first sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||that the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals||Such multi-crystal materials will probably be needed for commercial applications .||The first sentence states a limitation of multi-crystal samples of superconductors: their current-carrying capacity is too low for most practical uses due to weak links between crystals. The second sentence discusses the likely necessity of using such multi-crystal materials in commercial applications. These two sentences present a comparison by highlighting the practical need for multi-crystal superconductors despite their limitations. The comparison shows the trade-off between the materials' imperfections and their importance for commercial use.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||because it demonstrates how to overcome the `` flux pinning '' problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors ' potential||The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals , limiting their current-carrying capacity . Mr. van Dover said the crystal changes his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place , preventing them from lowering current-carrying capacity .||The first sentence states that there's a demonstration of overcoming the "flux pinning" problem, which affects the potential of new superconductors. The second sentence explains what the flux pinning problem is (motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals, limiting current-carrying capacity) and how Mr. van Dover's team addressed it (by changing the crystals to pin the magnetic fields in place). This detailed explanation of the problem and the solution expands upon the initial statement, providing more context and information about the issue and its resolution. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals , limiting their current-carrying capacity .||the crystal changes his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place , preventing them from lowering current-carrying capacity||The first sentence explains there is a problem with the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals that limits their current-carrying capacity. The second sentence introduces a solution where the crystal changes pin the magnetic fields in place, preventing the reduction of current-carrying capacity. The relationship is comparative because the second sentence contrasts the issue described in the first sentence by presenting a solution that addresses the problem of the magnetic fields' motion and its impact on current-carrying capacity. The crystal changes serve as a comparison to the initial problem by offering an alternative state where the magnetic fields do not limit the current-carrying capacity.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem||Determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed crystal-lattice patterns .||The first sentence states that researchers are working to identify specific crystal changes that solved a particular issue. The second sentence outlines a potential outcome of achieving this goal, suggesting that understanding these crystal changes could lead to improved methods for introducing necessary crystal-lattice patterns. The contingency relationship is established because the future development of better methods (second sentence) depends on the successful determination of the precise crystal changes (first sentence).
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The AT&T team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with `` melt-textured growth , '' a process discovered earlier at Bell Laboratories .||The combined processes may significantly raise the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples .||The first sentence states that the AT&T team is attempting to combine their recent superconductor process with another process called "melt-textured growth," which was previously discovered at Bell Laboratories. The second sentence describes a potential outcome of combining these processes: significantly raising the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples. The contingency relationship is established because the potential improvement (raised current-carrying capacity) is contingent upon the successful combination of the two processes. The second sentence depends on the first for context and describes a possible result of the action mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||The latest results include some unusual write-downs , which had an after-tax impact of $ 4.9 million .||Those included costs associated with the potential Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association acquisition , which was terminated on Sept. 27 , 1989 .||The first sentence mentions "unusual write-downs" that affected the financial results. The second sentence provides specific details about one of those write-downs, namely the costs related to a potential acquisition that was ultimately terminated. This detail expands upon the mention of unusual write-downs in the first sentence, giving more information about what those write-downs consisted of. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information provided in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||There is $ 30.9 million of fourth series bonds , the interest on which is not subject to the federal alternative minimum tax . They mature 1992-1999 , 2009 and 2017 . Fourth series serial bonds are priced at par to yield from 6.25 % in 1992 to 7 % in 1999 . The 7.40 % term bonds due 2009 are priced to yield 7.45 % , and 7.40 % term bonds due 2017 are priced to yield 7.50 % .||There is $ 49.9 million of fifth series bonds , which are subject to the federal alternative minimum tax . They mature in 2005 , 2009 and 2029 . Bonds due in 2005 have a 7 1/2 % coupon and are priced at par . The 7 5/8 % bonds due 2009 are priced to yield 7.65 % , and 7 5/8 % bonds due 2029 are priced at 98 1/2 to yield 7.74 % .||The first sentence provides information about the fourth series bonds, including details about their maturity dates, yields, and exemption from the federal alternative minimum tax. The second sentence expands on this information by discussing the fifth series bonds, which contrasts with the fourth series by being subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and having different maturity dates and yields. Both sets of sentences detail specific financial aspects of each bond series, but the second set provides additional context by introducing a related, yet distinct, series of bonds. This additional context expands the overall understanding of the financial instruments being discussed.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||, San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie hopes to have a new home for them .||He is an avid fan of a proposition on next week 's ballot to help build a replacement for Candlestick Park .||The first sentence states that Bob Lurie, the owner of the San Francisco Giants, hopes to find a new home for the team. The second sentence explains that he is a strong supporter of a proposition aimed at constructing a new stadium to replace Candlestick Park. The contingency relationship is evident because Lurie's hope for a new home for the team is contingent on the success of the proposition to build the replacement stadium. His support for the proposition is directly related to his desire for a new home for the team.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Small wonder , since he 's asking San Francisco taxpayers to sink up to $ 100 million into the new stadium .||As San Francisco digs out from The Pretty Big One , opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium .||The first sentence highlights the significant financial commitment required from San Francisco taxpayers for the new stadium. The second sentence discusses the perspective of opponents who argue that the city cannot afford the stadium, especially after a major event (The Pretty Big One). The comparison lies in contrasting the substantial investment needed for the stadium with the city's financial situation post-disaster. The opponents' viewpoint is compared to the financial demand of the stadium project, emphasizing the perceived incompatibility of the expense with the city's recovery needs.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Most boosters claim the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city .||Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim scoffs at that .||The first sentence presents the viewpoint of most boosters who believe that new sports complexes will generate revenue for their cities. The second sentence introduces Dean Baim, an economist from Pepperdine University, who has a different opinion. The relationship is one of comparison because it contrasts the general optimism of the boosters with Baim's skeptical stance. Baim's scoffing is a form of disagreement or contrast to the claims made by the boosters.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim scoffs at that .||He has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out .||The first sentence indicates that Dean Baim is dismissive of some unspecified claim or idea. The second sentence provides evidence for why Baim might be skeptical: his research shows that only one stadium (Dodger Stadium) had a positive economic impact. Baim's skepticism (as indicated by "scoffs") is contingent upon his findings from studying the economic impacts of various stadiums. His attitude is based on the results of his research, making the relationship between the sentences a contingent one.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'rather'] ||and found that only one -- -- brought more money into a city than it took out||Stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community , not create more of it .||The first sentence states that only one stadium brought more money into a city than it took out. The second sentence explains why this is typically the case: stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community rather than create new wealth. In other words, the second sentence expands on the first by providing a reason for why most stadiums do not bring a net financial benefit to a city. It elaborates on the economic impact of stadiums, explaining the mechanism (redistribution of wealth) behind the observed outcome in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium .||San Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago .||The first sentence makes a general statement about voters agreeing to decide on investing in a new mega-stadium. The second sentence provides a specific example of this general statement by referring to San Francisco voters rejecting a new ballpark two years ago. This specific instance expands on the general idea presented in the first sentence, illustrating how voters can indeed decide against funding a stadium, as mentioned in the general statement. Thus, the second sentence expands on the concept introduced in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||San Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago .||Last month , Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $ 100 million stadium bond and tax proposition .||The first sentence discusses how San Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago. The second sentence provides another instance of voters rejecting a stadium-related measure: Phoenix voters recently voted against a stadium bond and tax proposition. The second sentence expands on the initial point by offering a similar situation in a different location, highlighting a broader pattern of voter rejection of stadium projects.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'although'] ||Last month , Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $ 100 million stadium bond and tax proposition .||Its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- -- and spent $ 100,000 on promotion .||The first sentence states that Phoenix voters rejected a $100 million stadium bond and tax proposition.The second sentence provides information about the efforts of the proposition's supporters, who had significant backing and spent $100,000 on promotion. The comparison is drawn between the substantial support and financial investment made by the proposition's backers and the ultimate failure of the proposition at the polls. This contrast highlights the unexpected outcome despite significant support and promotional efforts.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'since'] ||George Christopher , the former San Francisco mayor who built Candlestick Park for the Giants in the 1960s , wo n't endorse the new ballpark .||He says he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed they needed 10,000 parking spaces . Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces , Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal `` games '' of their own with the voters .||The first sentence states that George Christopher, who previously built Candlestick Park for the Giants, will not endorse the new ballpark. The second sentence explains his reasoning: he believes the backers are manipulating financial details, given the significant difference in required parking spaces between the old and new parks. Therefore, the reason provided for his non-endorsement creates a contingent relationship, where his stance depends on his perception of the backers' financial practices.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed they needed 10,000 parking spaces||Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces backers are playing some fiscal `` games '' of their own with the voters||The first sentence states that Candlestick Park was built due to the Giants' claim of needing 10,000 parking spaces. The second sentence mentions that the new park will only have 1,500 spaces, and backers are using financial strategies with the voters. The comparison lies in the contrast between the number of parking spaces required for building Candlestick Park and the significantly fewer spaces in the new park. This discrepancy suggests a change in approach or need, leading to a comparison between the two situations.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built .||Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees , and he can prove it .||The first sentence presents the viewpoint of stadium boosters who argue that public funding is necessary for the construction of stadiums. The second sentence introduces Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie, who holds a different opinion and claims to have evidence supporting his stance. The relationship is one of comparison because the two sentences contrast the views of stadium boosters with those of Joe Robbie, highlighting a difference in opinion regarding the need for public money in building stadiums.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees , and he can prove it .||Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl , and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds .||In the first sentence, we learn that Joe Robbie, the owner of the Miami Dolphins, disagrees with something and can prove his stance. The second sentence expands on what he did to prove his point: he stopped trying to convince Miami to upgrade the Orange Bowl and instead constructed his own stadium using private funds. This action serves as evidence of his disagreement, thus expanding on the initial claim in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl , and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds .||He did n't see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit .||The first sentence states that the individual stopped trying to convince Miami to improve the Orange Bowl and chose to construct his own coliseum using private funds. The second sentence explains his reasoning for not wanting taxpayers' money to be used for building the facility he would profit from. This reasoning led to his decision to privately fund his own coliseum, illustrating a contingency relationship where the decision to build privately is contingent upon his belief that he shouldn't benefit financially from public funds.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||But to Moon Landrieu , the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that city 's cavernous , money-losing Superdome , questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance .||The Superdome is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith||The first sentence indicates that Moon Landrieu, who was involved in building the Superdome, does not prioritize financial considerations or questions about beneficiaries. The second sentence presents the Superdome as an embodiment of optimism and faith. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the perspective attributed to Moon Landrieu (disregarding practical concerns) leads to viewing the Superdome as more of an optimistic endeavor rather than a financial investment. The way Moon Landrieu perceives the Superdome is contingent upon his disregard for financial or utilitarian aspects, thus framing it as a symbol of hope and belief in the future.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||The Superdome is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith||`` It is the very building of it that is important , not how much of it is used or its economics . ''||The first sentence describes the Superdome as an embodiment of optimism and faith. The second sentence explains that the significance of the Superdome lies in its construction rather than its usage or economic viability. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the importance of the Superdome being built (second sentence) is contingent upon its symbolic value (first sentence). In other words, the reason why building the Superdome is significant is due to what it represents (optimism and faith), making the relationship between the sentences one of contingency.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||But civilization has moved forward since then .||Today taxpayers get to vote , most of the time , on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs , or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions .||The first sentence states that civilization has progressed over time. The second sentence elaborates on this progress by providing a specific example of how taxpayers now have a say in financing public projects. This expansion of the original idea through a detailed example illustrates how the concept of societal advancement includes giving citizens more control and involvement in decision-making processes. Thus, the second sentence expands upon the idea introduced in the first sentence by offering a concrete way in which civilization has indeed moved forward.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business , so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s||`` A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible . ''||The first sentence makes a comparison, suggesting that just as the 1980s bull market had a significant impact on the U.S. securities business, the challenging environment of the 1990s will also bring about major changes. The second sentence expands on this idea by proposing that a sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible. The relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence provides additional detail or elaboration on the anticipated changes mentioned in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as'] ||What worries credit-rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings .||That 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors .||The first sentence outlines the primary concern for credit-rating agencies, which is Wall Street firms taking long-term risks with their own capital through leveraged buyouts and junk bond financings. The second sentence explains how this situation differs from the past practice where Wall Street firms would transfer nearly all financing risks to investors. The shift in risk management strategy by Wall Street firms (taking on more risk themselves) is contingent upon the change from their traditional practice (transferring risks to investors). The new behavior is a departure from the old one, which establishes a contingency relationship between the two sentences.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation||Merchant banking , where firms commit their own money , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it to go around . '' In addition the buy-out business is under pressure `` because of the junk bond collapse , '' meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks .||The first sentence states that Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation, which implies a complex dilemma or difficult situation with no easy way out. The following sentences provide reasons for this situation by explaining the increased risks in merchant banking and the pressures on the buy-out business due to the junk bond collapse. These explanations indicate that the described conditions (risks in merchant banking and pressures on the buy-out business) are contributing factors to the Catch-22 situation faced by Wall Street. Therefore, the relationship between the sentences is one of contingency, where the latter sentences provide the context or reasons for the situation mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||it `` expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry , which , combined with overcapacity , will create poor prospects for profitability||that the `` temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor||The first sentence outlines the expectation of intense competition and its consequences (overcapacity and poor profitability prospects) in the securities industry. The second sentence expands on the situation by introducing an additional consequence or factor: the temptation for management to mitigate profit pressure by taking greater risks. This explains that due to the conditions outlined in the first sentence, there is an increased likelihood of management taking on higher risks, which further impacts the industry's outlook. Thus, the second sentence expands on the implications of the scenario described in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Both Moody 's and S&P cited First Boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking , which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit .||The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp. , First Boston 's most lucrative client of the decade , is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $ 3 billion of high-yield , high-risk junk financings for Campeau units .||The first sentence states that both Moody's and S&P mentioned First Boston's dependence on merchant banking in recent years, which has contributed significantly to the company's profits. The second sentence provides specific details about one aspect of this reliance: the cash squeeze at Campeau Corp., a particularly profitable client for First Boston, and the implications of arranging high-risk financings for its units. This additional information expands on the initial point about First Boston's reliance on merchant banking by giving a concrete example of how this strategy played out with one of its clients. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is Expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston 's equity||`` Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity . ''||The first sentence states that the two exposures constitute a significant part of CS First Boston's equity. The second sentence broadens this context by mentioning that total merchant banking exposures exceed the firm's equity. The relationship of expansion is demonstrated here because the second sentence provides additional information that places the initial statement into a wider context. It explains that not only do these two exposures represent a substantial portion of the equity, but the total merchant banking exposures go beyond the entire equity of the firm.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||In addition , Shearson 's listed $ 2 billion of capital is overstated , according to the rating concerns , because it includes $ 1.7 billion of goodwill .||Shearson `` really only has $ 300 million of capital||The first sentence states that Shearson's reported capital of $2 billion is overstated due to including $1.7 billion of goodwill, implying the actual capital is less than reported. The second sentence provides the recalculated figure for Shearson's capital, stating it "really only has $300 million of capital." This figure ($300 million) is contingent upon the adjustment mentioned in the first sentence (removing the $1.7 billion of goodwill from the total). Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the second sentence provides a consequence or result of the adjustment mentioned in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||the firm is n't worried||A year ago , Moody 's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade `` After two months of talks , our rating was maintained . ''||The first sentence indicates the current state of the firm not being worried.The second sentence provides context for this state by describing a past event where Moody's considered downgrading Shearson but ultimately maintained its rating after discussions. This past outcome (rating maintained) likely contributed to the firm's current lack of worry, establishing a contingent relationship. The firm's current state of not being worried is contingent upon the positive outcome of the previous review by Moody's.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'but'] ||A year ago , Moody 's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade||`` After two months of talks , our rating was maintained . ''||The first sentence states that Moody's had Shearson under review for a possible downgrade a year ago. The second sentence indicates that following two months of talks, Shearson's rating was maintained. The comparison relationship can be explained as follows: Both sentences discuss Moody's review of Shearson's credit rating. The first sentence sets the context by mentioning the initial review and potential downgrade. The second sentence contrasts this by stating the outcome of the review, which is that the rating was maintained. This comparison highlights the difference between the potential negative outcome (downgrade) and the actual outcome (rating maintained).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal .||Drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business , cutting the firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 .||The first sentence discusses the firm's legal troubles, including financial settlements and a guilty plea to felonies linked to an insider-trading scandal. The second sentence provides additional context by explaining that Drexel closed its retail or individual customer business this year, resulting in significant layoffs. This additional information expands on the firm's challenges, showing how the legal issues may have impacted its operations and workforce. Thus, the relationship is one of expansion, where the second sentence broadens our understanding of the firm's situation beyond just the legal troubles mentioned in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness .||We 're well positioned with $ 1.7 billion of capital||The first sentence indicates Drexel's confidence in its future creditworthiness. The second sentence provides information about Drexel being well-positioned with a significant amount of capital ($1.7 billion). The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because Drexel's confidence in its creditworthiness is contingent upon its strong financial position (having $1.7 billion of capital). The substantial capital acts as the basis for Drexel's confidence, thus establishing a contingent relationship between the two sentences.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week when the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm .||We can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who 've been hurt .||The first sentence criticizes the Supreme Court's decision not to hear an appeal in a case where corporate defendants were held liable for damages despite evidence to the contrary. The second sentence acknowledges the judicial inclination to provide relief to those who have been injured. The comparison lies in contrasting the perceived legal absurdity with the understandable human impulse to help victims. This highlights the tension between the desire for fairness and the potential for unjust outcomes in the legal system.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk , technology and innovation .||Too often now , a single court decision becomes the precedent for other , less compelling cases .||The first sentence highlights the failure of traditional policy-making processes, leading to courts becoming the primary venue for debates on risk, technology, and innovation. The second sentence discusses the consequence of this situation where a single court decision sets a precedent for other cases. The contingency relationship is established because the condition (courts being the main forum due to policy-making failures) leads to the result (a single court decision influencing other cases). The second sentence explains an outcome contingent upon the circumstances described in the first sentence.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and marketed by some 300 pharmaceutical companies , often under generic labels .||In the 1970s , scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of DES users .||The first sentence indicates that the drug (presumably DES, given the context of daughters of users and later mention of cancer cases) was approved and widely distributed by numerous pharmaceutical companies, sometimes under generic names. The second sentence introduces information about cancer cases reported among the daughters of DES users in the 1970s. The temporal relationship here is that the events described in the second sentence (reporting of cancer cases) occurred after the events in the first sentence (approval and marketing of the drug). Therefore, the sequence of events establishes a temporal relationship.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||The cases quickly went to court , but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used .||Beginning in 1980 , courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable .||The first sentence indicates that legal cases involving DES plaintiffs were expedited to court, and one issue was that the mothers couldn't recall the specific brand of the drug they had used. The second sentence then introduces a change in legal practice starting in 1980, where courts in some states suspended the common-law rule requiring plaintiffs to prove the liability of the defendants. This shift in legal approach follows the initial court proceedings mentioned in the first sentence, establishing a temporal relationship. The cases going to court happened before the courts decided to change the common-law rule, setting up a sequence of events over time.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Alternative', 'instead'] ||Beginning in 1980 , courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable .||Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same , and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales .||The first sentence states that courts in certain states suspended the common-law rule requiring plaintiffs to prove the liability of defendants, specifically mentioning the year and some of the states involved.The second sentence provides more detail about how the courts handled the situation, by assuming all DES pills were the same and using a market-share test for assessing damages. This additional information expands on the change in legal approach mentioned in the first sentence, explaining how the courts implemented the suspension of the common-law rule. Therefore, the relationship is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||This has some logic .||Drug makers should n't be able to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used .||The first sentence states that there is some logic to a particular viewpoint or argument. The second sentence provides a specific reason supporting that viewpoint: if drug makers cannot be held liable due to the inability to identify the exact drug used, it would present a logical issue. The reason (the issue with drug makers avoiding liability) is contingent upon the initial statement that there is some logic to the argument. The second sentence explains a scenario that logically supports the idea presented in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||But courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope .||Just as all plaintiffs are not alike , it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties .||The first sentence indicates that courts faced challenges or made decisions that led to unforeseen negative outcomes.The second sentence presents a situation that courts had to consider: differences among DES defendants in marketing and warranties. This situation could contribute to the challenges mentioned in the first sentence, explaining why courts might "tumble down a slippery slope." The contingency relationship is established because the specific issue with DES defendants (second sentence) is a factor contributing to the broader challenge faced by the courts (first sentence).
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes , by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California .||Despite the Supreme Court 's refusal to hear the case , there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants .||The first sentence presents a scenario observed by Professor William Van Alstyne where, based on certain reasoning, a defendant could be held liable in New York for a product issue that occurred elsewhere.The second sentence discusses the existence of serious constitutional issues related to due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants, despite the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case. The contingency here lies in the connection between the hypothetical legal situation described by Professor Van Alstyne and the actual constitutional issues mentioned. The second sentence explains potential consequences or related issues arising from the scenario presented in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine .||The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs .||The first sentence states that the issue at hand extends beyond just distorting legal principles. The second sentence explains a specific instance of this problem: the California Supreme Court changed its stance to increase the difficulty of winning DES cases due to the negative impact of pharmaceutical lawsuits on the development of new drugs. This instance serves as an elaboration or expansion of the broader issue mentioned in the first sentence, illustrating how the problem manifests in real-world legal decisions.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs||The court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs , citing the huge , hidden social costs .||The first sentence indicates that the justices observed a consequence of pharmaceutical litigation - it has had a chilling effect on the introduction of new drugs. The second sentence tells us that the court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs, partly due to considering the significant, unseen social costs. The court's decision (rejecting strict liability) appears to be contingent upon their observation of the negative impacts of pharmaceutical litigation on innovation. The justices' concern over the impact of litigation led to a specific judicial action, creating a contingent relationship between the observation and the decision.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||citing the huge , hidden social costs||`` Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs , even though some risks , perhaps serious ones , might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering , '' the unanimous court said .||The first part of the sentence discusses "huge, hidden social costs," suggesting there are significant but unacknowledged downsides to a situation. The second part explains that public policy supports the development and marketing of new drugs despite potential risks, because these drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering. This section expands on the idea of social costs by specifying one area where such costs occur—the pharmaceutical industry—and provides context for why these costs are accepted (i.e., the benefits of new drugs). Thus, the second part provides additional detail and elaboration on the concept of hidden social costs introduced in the first part, establishing an expansion relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs , even though some risks , perhaps serious ones , might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering||that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug , Bendectin , off the U.S. market||The first sentence discusses the public policy stance on new drugs, acknowledging the potential risks but emphasizing the benefits such as saving lives, reducing pain, and suffering. The second sentence provides an example of a drug, Bendectin, being withdrawn from the market due to litigation fears. The comparison lies in contrasting the supportive policy environment for new drugs with the reality of drug withdrawal due to legal concerns. Both sentences discuss the context of drug availability and risk management, setting up a comparison between the ideal policy position and real-world consequences.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'since'] ||This raises the key issue : What to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs ?||We now know that holding drug makers liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs wo n't be available to anyone .||The first sentence introduces a key issue regarding what actions should be taken for individuals who experience severe injuries due to beneficial drugs. The second sentence discusses the consequence of holding drug manufacturers liable when there was no prior knowledge of the risks. The relationship is contingent because the second sentence presents a potential outcome or consideration that arises from the issue raised in the first sentence. Specifically, if drug makers are held liable without evidence of prior knowledge of risks, it could lead to the unavailability of those drugs.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||We now know that holding drug makers liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs wo n't be available to anyone .||, after the Hymowitz case , if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug `` it 's time to sell that company 's stock short . ''||The first sentence outlines the consequence of holding drug manufacturers liable without evidence of known risks: the unavailability of certain drugs. The second sentence provides a specific scenario exemplifying this consequence through the Hymowitz case, suggesting that following such a case, introducing an anti-miscarriage drug would negatively impact the stock value of the company. This specific example expands upon the broader implication stated in the first sentence, illustrating how holding drug makers liable in such circumstances can lead to financial repercussions for them.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway||some win the legal lottery , others get much less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either way||The first sentence states that the tort system is not a good method for compensating victims. The second sentence provides specific examples of how compensation can vary widely and mentions that lawyers often take a significant portion of the compensation through contingency fees. These details are given as evidence supporting the claim that the tort system has flaws, especially regarding the inconsistency in compensation and the high costs associated with legal representation. Therefore, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, offering reasons and examples to back up the initial assertion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts .||Congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs .||The first sentence proposes a solution for helping DES daughters and other victims of drugs by suggesting their cases should not be handled in courts. The second sentence expands on this idea by suggesting a specific alternative: Congress creating a compensation program. This program would serve the same goal of assisting the victims, as mentioned in the first sentence, but adds detail about how this assistance could work and what additional benefits it might provide (such as protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs). Thus, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first one by providing a more concrete proposal.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||this is one reason judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to trash the law in the DES cases||They must figure that justice has to get done by somebody , but know it wo n't be done by Congress .||The first sentence states that judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to alter or ignore the law in DES cases. The second sentence explains part of the reasoning behind this behavior: they believe justice needs to be carried out, even if Congress won't do it. The second sentence expands on the first by providing insight into the judges' and justices' motivations for their actions in the DES cases.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||The 32 % state-owned DSM had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter , mainly to reflect one-time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations .||The charges were offset in part by a gain from the sale of the company 's construction division .||The first sentence states that DSM had extraordinary charges primarily related to one-time losses from disposing of certain operations. The second sentence indicates there was a gain from the sale of the company's construction division. The comparison relationship exists because the gain from the sale of the construction division is mentioned in relation to the extraordinary charges, suggesting that the gain partially offsets the charges. This shows a comparison between negative financial impacts (charges) and positive financial impacts (gains).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||The committee 's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of Poland 's own farmers .||Rep. Gary Ackerman noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt .||The first sentence states that the committee members are worried about the potential negative impact of free food on Poland's farmers' economic prospects. The second sentence provides additional context by mentioning Rep. Gary Ackerman's observation that previous food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt. This additional information expands on the initial concern by providing specific examples of similar situations where food aid negatively affected local farmers. Therefore, the second sentence serves to expand the context or support the concern expressed in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||that past food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt||However well intentioned , food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country 's own farmers .||The first sentence states that past food aid had a negative effect on farmers in El Salvador and Egypt.The second sentence discusses a general tendency of food aid to expand and harm market incentives for local farmers in recipient countries. The second sentence explains a reason or mechanism (how food aid grows larger and harms market incentives) for the outcome mentioned in the first sentence (that food aid harmed farmers). Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the second sentence provides a contingent explanation for the situation described in the first.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||The First World has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other people 's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness .||It should be constantly stressed that Poland 's farmers mostly need a real market for their products .||The first sentence criticizes the practice of the First World economies overwhelming other economies with untargeted aid. The second sentence emphasizes the specific need of Polish farmers for a genuine market for their goods. The relationship is one of contingency because the second sentence presents a necessary condition or solution in response to the problem outlined in the first sentence. In other words, the assertion about what Polish farmers need is contingent upon the critique of the First World's aid practices.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||it expects to post sales in the current fiscal year that are `` slightly above '' fiscal 1989 sales of $ 155 million||its industrial unit continues to face margin pressures and lower demand||The first sentence states the expectation of sales for the current fiscal year being slightly above the $155 million from fiscal 1989. The second sentence provides additional context about the company's industrial unit facing margin pressures and lower demand. This additional information expands on the challenges the company is experiencing, which could impact its sales expectations. Thus, the second sentence is an expansion of the situation described in the first sentence, giving more detail about the factors influencing the company's financial outlook.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||it is in the process of phasing out John Deere , its current source of production for midsized motor home chassis||In anticipation of the start-up of its new factory , a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built to carry it through the transition period .||The first sentence indicates that the entity is in the process of phasing out John Deere as its supplier for midsized motor home chassis. The second sentence explains an action taken in anticipation of this change: building a larger-than-normal chassis supply. The action (building up supply) is contingent upon the event (phasing out John Deere). Specifically, the larger supply is intended to support operations during the transition period, showing that one sentence depends on the other for context.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Tokyu Group , Mitsubishi Estate and Bridgestone/Firestone , which advanced Tuesday , declined on profit-taking .||Wednesday 's dominant issue was Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance , which continued to surge on rumors of speculative buying .||The first sentence states that Tokyu Group, Mitsubishi Estate, and Bridgestone/Firestone declined after advancing on the previous trading day due to profit-taking. The second sentence introduces Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance as Wednesday’s dominant issue, noting its continued surge based on rumors of speculative buying.The Expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence expands on the context set by the first one. Both sentences discuss events occurring within the same timeframe (over two consecutive trading days). The first sentence sets the stage for stock market activity, while the second sentence provides additional detail by focusing on a specific company's (Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance) performance and the factors influencing it. This expansion of information helps provide a broader picture of the stock market activities over those days.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Wednesday 's dominant issue was Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance , which continued to surge on rumors of speculative buying .||It ended the day up 80 yen 56 cents to 1,880 yen $ 13.15 .||The first sentence states that Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance was the dominant issue on Wednesday and continued to surge due to rumors of speculative buying. The second sentence provides more specific information about the stock's performance, stating that it ended the day up 80 yen at 1,880 yen. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving concrete details about the extent of the surge mentioned in the first sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Teikoku Oil , also stimulated by rumors of speculative buying , advanced 100 yen to 1,460 .||Showa Shell gained 20 to 1,570||In the first sentence, Teikoku Oil's stock price movement is described, noting that it advanced by 100 yen to reach 1,460 yen due to rumors of speculative buying.In the second sentence, Showa Shell's stock price movement is mentioned, with a gain of 20 yen to reach 1,570 yen.No causal connection or temporal sequence is indicated; instead, the two sentences present parallel information about the stock price changes for two different companies, allowing for a comparison between the extent of their gains and their resulting prices.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Sterling 's firm tone , combined with a steady opening on Wall Street , also tempted some investors to come back to the market||There were concerns early in the day that Wall Street 's sharp gains on Tuesday were overdone and due for a reversal .||The first sentence indicates factors that encouraged investors to return to the market: Sterling's firm tone and a steady opening on Wall Street. The second sentence mentions concerns about Wall Street's sharp gains from the previous day, suggesting a contrasting situation where there was uncertainty and fear of a reversal. The relationship is one of comparison because the two sentences contrast the positive influences that brought investors back with the earlier concerns about potential negative outcomes.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The FT 30-share index settled 16.7 points higher at 1738.1 .||Volume was 372.9 million shares , up from 334.5 million on Tuesday .||The first sentence provides information about the FT 30-share index settling 16.7 points higher at 1738.1. The second sentence expands on the context by providing additional details about trading volume, noting that it increased to 372.9 million shares from 334.5 million shares on the previous day. This detail adds more information to the market activity described in the first sentence, thus forming an expansionary relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Dealers said institutions were still largely hugging the sidelines on fears that the market 's recent technical rally might prove fragile .||They cited Wall Street 's recent volatility and the lack of a clear indication over the market 's short-term direction as factors in the institutional caution .||The first sentence states that institutions are hesitant to engage more deeply with the market due to concerns about the fragility of its recent technical rally. The second sentence expands on this hesitancy by specifying reasons for it: Wall Street’s recent volatility and the lack of a clear short-term direction. Thus, the second sentence adds detail to the first by explaining what specific factors are contributing to the institutional caution mentioned in the first sentence, making the relationship one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Drug companies in the key index also notched gains .||Wellcome gained 18 to 666 on a modest 1.1 million shares .||The first sentence states that drug companies in the key index experienced gains.The second sentence provides specific information about one of those drug companies, Wellcome, detailing its gain and the volume of shares traded. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by offering more detail about a particular company mentioned in the broader context of the gains experienced by drug companies.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Wellcome gained 18 to 666 on a modest 1.1 million shares .||Glaxo , the U.K. 's largest pharmaceutical concern , advanced 23 to # 14.13 .||In the first sentence, we learn about the stock movement for Wellcome, which gained 18 points reaching 666 with a specific volume of shares traded. The second sentence discusses Glaxo, another company in the same industry, advancing 23 points to reach 14.13. These sentences are related through expansion because they both describe the upward movement in stock prices of two companies within the same sector (U.K. pharmaceuticals). This relationship highlights the positive trend in the stock market for this particular industry at the time of reporting.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Stock prices closed higher in Stockholm , Amsterdam and Frankfurt and lower in Zurich .||Paris , Brussels , and Milan were closed for a holiday .||The first sentence provides information about stock price movements in several cities (Stockholm, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Zurich).The second sentence adds more context by mentioning that other cities (Paris, Brussels, and Milan) had their markets closed for a holiday. This additional information expands the scope of the situation described in the first sentence, providing a broader picture of the market conditions across different European cities. Thus, the relationship is one of expansion, where the second sentence broadens the context of the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Stock prices closed higher in Stockholm , Amsterdam and Frankfurt and lower in Zurich . Paris , Brussels , and Milan were closed for a holiday .||South African gold stocks closed marginally lower .||The first sentence provides information about the closing stock prices in various European cities, noting both increases and decreases, as well as closures due to a holiday.In the second sentence, the focus shifts to South African gold stocks, which closed slightly lower. This sentence expands the scope of the financial report to include not only European markets but also the South African market, providing additional context and detail about global market movements. Therefore, the second sentence serves as an expansion of the financial market overview started in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Elsewhere , share prices closed higher in Singapore , Taipei and Wellington , were mixed in Hong Kong , lower in Seoul and little changed in Sydney .||Manila markets were closed for a holiday .||The first sentence provides information about how share prices moved in various Asian markets.In the second sentence, we learn that the Manila market was closed for a holiday, which explains why there is no mention of its movement in the first sentence. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence adds more context to the first by including Manila's market status, thereby expanding the scope of the information provided about Asian markets.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Hold the Putty !||With lipsticks , liners , lotions and creams , There are still beauty plans left to tackle||The command "Hold the Putty!" suggests an interruption or pause in an activity. The second sentence introduces other beauty products and tasks that remain. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the continuation of activities (using lipsticks, liners, etc.) is contingent upon pausing the current one (working with putty). The speaker implies that there are more beauty tasks to address once the current one is paused, creating a dependent relationship between the two sentences.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The sharp stock market decline in late October appears to have had little or no effect on consumers||`` Survey returns received after the drop in the Dow Jones average were about the same as the views expressed prior to that event . ''||The first sentence states that the sharp stock market decline in late October seems to have had little to no impact on consumers. The second sentence provides evidence for this claim by noting that survey responses received after the Dow Jones average dropped were similar to those received before the event. Thus, the second sentence is contingent upon the first one, providing supporting detail for the claim that consumers were largely unaffected.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||its Consumer Confidence Index was 116.4 in October , barely changed from a revised 116.3 in September||The index was 116.9 in October 1988 and in the past year has ranged from a low of 112.9 to a high of 120.7 .||The first sentence provides the Consumer Confidence Index values for October and the revised value for September, showing they are nearly identical. The second sentence offers the index value from October 1988 and the range over the past year. These details allow for a comparison of the current index value to historical data. By mentioning the past values, the text compares the current index with previous years', highlighting how it fits within the recent historical context.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||In October , more people said that present business conditions were `` good '' than in September .||An equal number in each month said that employment conditions were good .||The first sentence states that there was an increase in the number of people who found present business conditions "good" in October compared to September. The second sentence provides additional information about public perception, specifying that an equal number of people in both months considered employment conditions good. This second sentence expands on the idea of public perception of economic conditions, adding detail to the overall context of how people viewed different aspects of the economy over those two months.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||In October 1989 , 16.9 % said more jobs will be created in the coming six months , compared with 17.4 % in September and 18.6 % in October 1988 .||Only 26.8 % in October , compared with 28.5 % in September and 26.8 % in October 1988 , said income would increase .||Both sentences present comparisons of percentages across different time periods for similar types of expectations (job creation and income increase). The expansion relationship indicates that the second sentence expands on the theme of changing public expectations over time, specifically regarding economic optimism, introduced in the first sentence. The details of the percentages and the trend over time provide additional context and data points, further developing the picture of how expectations have changed.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The sustained level of confidence can be attributed to the continued favorable circumstances which affect the consumer 's day-to-day economic life||`` Unemployment continues at a relatively low level , providing a sense of job security , and a low inflation rate has kept the purchasing power of the weekly paycheck reasonably strong . ''||The first sentence states that the sustained level of confidence is due to continued favorable circumstances affecting consumers' daily economic lives. The second sentence elaborates on what these favorable circumstances are: low unemployment leading to job security and low inflation maintaining purchasing power. This provides more specific detail to support the claim made in the first sentence, thus forming an expansion relationship. The additional information directly explains and expands upon the favorable circumstances mentioned initially.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||In October , 6.7 % of respondents said they will buy a car , easing from September when 8.1 % anticipated a purchase .||In October 1988 , 7.3 % said they would buy a car .||The first sentence provides data for October, indicating that 6.7% of respondents planned to buy a car, which is a decrease from September's 8.1%.The second sentence gives a historical figure for October 1988, where 7.3% of people said they would buy a car.Both sentences discuss the percentage of people planning to buy a car in October but in different years, allowing for a comparison over time. This comparison helps understand how consumer sentiment has changed regarding car purchases in the specified months.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Home purchase plans increased to 3.3 % from 3.1 % in the two recent months .||In October 1988 , 3.7 % said they would buy a house .||The first sentence states that home purchase plans rose to 3.3% from 3.1% over the two most recent months. The second sentence provides a historical data point, indicating that in October 1988, 3.7% of people said they would buy a house. These two sentences form a comparison as they both present percentages of individuals planning to buy homes but at different points in time, allowing for a comparison of home purchase intentions.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||In October 1988 , 3.7 % said they would buy a house .||In 1989 , home purchase plans have ranged monthly from 2.9 % to 3.7 % of respondents .||The first sentence provides a specific data point: in October 1988, 3.7% of respondents said they would buy a house. The second sentence offers more context around this data point by providing a range of percentages for home purchase plans over a period (1989). The 3.7% figure from the first sentence fits within the range provided in the second sentence, which expands on the initial data point by giving a broader picture of home purchase intentions over time.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Money managers ranked IBM 's offering as the most significant investment-grade sale of the year because large issues of long-term debt by companies with triple-A credit are infrequent .||the debentures were snapped by up pension funds , banks , insurance companies and other institutional investors||The first sentence explains why IBM's offering was considered significant: large, long-term debt issues from triple-A rated companies are rare. The second sentence expands on the significance by detailing who purchased the debentures, namely pension funds, banks, insurance companies, and other institutional investors. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence provides additional information that supports and elaborates on the reason for the significance mentioned in the first sentence.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Synchrony', 'meanwhile'] ||the debentures were snapped by up pension funds , banks , insurance companies and other institutional investors||In the Treasury market , investors paid scant attention to the day 's economic reports , which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy .||The first sentence describes an event where debentures were quickly purchased by various institutional investors. The second sentence details a separate event in the Treasury market, where investors largely ignored the day's economic reports due to their mixed nature. These sentences exhibit a Temporal relationship because they describe two distinct events that happened in succession within the broader context of financial market activities. However, there is no direct connection or causality suggested between the purchase of debentures and the reaction to economic reports in the Treasury market.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||A survey by the Federal Reserve 's 12 district banks and the latest report by the National Association of Purchasing Management blurred that picture of the economy .||In a monthly report prepared for use at the Fed 's next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 14. , the nation 's central bank found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in recent weeks .||The first sentence states that surveys and reports, including one from the Federal Reserve, have complicated the understanding of the economy's state. The second sentence provides more specific details about the Federal Reserve's report, indicating that it will be used at an upcoming meeting and that it shows moderated price increases and sluggish economic growth. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by providing additional information about the content of the Federal Reserve's report that contributes to the "blurred" picture of the economy mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The average estimate of 22 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in October .||The economists forecast a 0.1 % rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4 % .||Both sentences present forecasts made by economists regarding economic indicators. The first sentence details the consensus expectation for non-farm payroll growth, while the second sentence outlines the expected change in the unemployment rate. These forecasts are related through the broader context of economic predictions; an expansion in non-farm payrolls can influence expectations for the unemployment rate. However, they do not directly cause each other or depend on each other, nor are they presented as contradictory or alternative scenarios. Instead, they are separate but related aspects of economic forecasting, hence the Expansion relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The Treasury said the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling .||Until such action takes places , the Treasury has no ability to issue new debt of any kind .||The first sentence states that the Treasury's refunding is dependent on an increase in the federal debt ceiling being approved by Congress and the President. The second sentence explains that until this approval happens, the Treasury cannot issue any new debt. The comparison relationship is demonstrated here by contrasting the Treasury's ability to proceed with refunding (if the debt ceiling is raised) with its inability to do so (until the approval occurs). The sentences highlight the conditional nature of the Treasury's actions based on external legislative approval, setting up a comparison between what can happen with and without the necessary authorization.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Meanwhile , Treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading .||The benchmark 30-year bond about 1/4 point , or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .||The first sentence states that Treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading. The second sentence provides specific details about the increase in the benchmark 30-year bond, which is a type of Treasury bond. The second sentence expands upon the first by giving more precise information about the extent of the increase ("about 1/4 point") and the financial impact of this change (an increase of $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount). Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence elaborates on the details of the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The benchmark 30-year bond about 1/4 point , or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .||The benchmark was priced at 102 22/32 to yield 7.88 % compared with 102 12/32 to yield 7.90 % Tuesday .||The first sentence states that the benchmark 30-year bond changed by about 1/4 point or provided a specific equivalent value for each $1,000 face amount. The second sentence expands on this information by providing more detailed specifics regarding the pricing and yield of the bond on different days. It gives precise figures for the price and yield of the bond, thereby expanding on the initial statement about the bond's movement.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The benchmark was priced at 102 22/32 to yield 7.88 % compared with 102 12/32 to yield 7.90 % Tuesday .||The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 100 22/32 to yield 7.88 % compared with 100 16/32 to yield 7.90 % .||The first sentence provides information about the pricing and yield of a benchmark, while the second sentence gives details about the pricing and yield of the latest 10-year notes. The comparison relationship is established through the similar yields of 7.88% for both the benchmark and the latest 10-year notes, despite different prices and yields from previous measurements (7.90% yield). This allows for a direct comparison of the two securities based on their current yields.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||For the year to date , total returns were topped by the 16.5 % of longer-term Treasury issues , closely followed by 15 % for investment-grade bonds .||Junk bonds trailed the group again .||The first sentence states that for the year to date, total returns were led by longer-term Treasury issues at 16.5%, with investment-grade bonds closely behind at 15%.The second sentence expands on the performance of different types of investments by mentioning that junk bonds trailed the group, meaning they had lower returns than the previously mentioned investments. Thus, the second sentence provides additional information about the comparative performance of junk bonds within the context established by the first sentence, which makes the relationship between the two sentences one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Junk bonds trailed the group again .||Even the 7.2 % return from the risk-free three-month Treasury bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1 % return from junk bonds||The first sentence states that junk bonds performed poorly compared to the group. The second sentence provides specific details to support the poor performance of junk bonds: the three-month Treasury bill, considered risk-free, had a higher return (7.2%) than junk bonds (4.1%). This additional information expands upon the initial statement about the poor performance of junk bonds, providing quantitative evidence for the claim. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||Even the 7.2 % return from the risk-free three-month Treasury bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1 % return from junk bonds||`` Little wonder that buyers for junk have been found wanting , '' .||The first sentence states that the risk-free three-month Treasury bill had a significantly higher return than junk bonds. The second sentence comments on the lack of buyers for junk bonds. The contingency relationship is established because the disappointing performance of junk bonds compared to the risk-free investment likely led to fewer buyers being interested in purchasing them. In other words, the poor relative performance of junk bonds (first sentence) has caused there to be little interest from buyers (second sentence).
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||An official for the lead underwriter declined to comment on the reason for the delay , but market participants speculated that a number of factors , including a lack of investor interest , were responsible .||The issue could be relaunched , possibly in a restructured form , as early as next week , according to the lead underwriter .||The first sentence indicates uncertainty and speculation about the reasons for the delay in an offering, mentioning that there could be a lack of investor interest among other factors. The second sentence provides more definitive information about the future of the offering, stating that it could be relaunched soon. The comparison relationship is established through the contrast between the uncertainty and speculation in the first sentence and the concrete plans for relaunch mentioned in the second sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||It is generally expected to be the usual 10-year , four billion mark issue .||Rumors to the contrary have been that it would be a six billion mark issue , or that the last Bund , a 7 % issue due October 1999 , would be increased by two billion marks .||The first sentence presents the general expectation for the size of the bond issue (10-year, four billion mark).The second sentence introduces alternative possibilities or rumors that differ from the general expectation, suggesting a larger size (six billion mark) or an increase to a previous bond (by two billion marks).These alternative scenarios are compared with the general expectation, highlighting the differences in the amounts involved. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is comparative.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Standard & Poor 's Corp. lowered to double-C from triple-C the rating on about $ 130 million of debt .||the textile and clothing company 's interest expense exceeds operating profit `` by a wide margin '' and it noted United 's estimated after-tax loss of $ 24 million for the year ended June 30 .||The first sentence states that Standard & Poor's Corp. downgraded the rating on a portion of the company's debt. The second sentence provides additional details about the company's financial situation, specifically mentioning that its interest expense significantly exceeds its operating profit and an estimated after-tax loss. The downgrade action taken by Standard & Poor's (in the first sentence) can be seen as contingent upon the poor financial health of the company, as described in the second sentence. The relationship indicates that the rating downgrade occurred due to the company's financial condition, making it a contingency relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||In the first nine months , net was $ 306 million , compared with a loss of $ 195 million in the 1988 period .||The year-ago results included a $ 415 million charge in the 1988 second quarter for underperforming real estate and mortgage loans .||The first sentence presents the financial results for the first nine months, noting a net profit of $306 million compared to a loss of $195 million in the same period the previous year (1988).The second sentence provides context for the comparison by explaining a specific factor that influenced the 1988 results: a $415 million charge for underperforming assets. This detail helps to understand why there was a loss in 1988, thus comparing the two periods by providing additional information about the 1988 results.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||and temporarily throws into chaos the House 's work on clean-air legislation .||As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Mr. Dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation .||The first sentence indicates a disruption to the House's work on clean-air legislation.The second sentence identifies Mr. Dingell's role as chairman of the committee with significant influence over such legislation. The contingency relationship is demonstrated by the fact that Mr. Dingell's position and control over the legislation could directly impact the progress of the clean-air legislation, including any potential chaos or disruption mentioned in the first sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Mr. Dingell 's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain , though additional cuts could be ordered later||Mr. Bush 's legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- -- by the year 2000 .||The first sentence outlines the proposed emission reduction by Mr. Dingell, specifying an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions, with the possibility of further reductions later. The second sentence details Mr. Bush’s plan, which aims for a 10 million ton cut in emissions by the year 2000. These sentences form a comparison by contrasting the amount of emissions each plan aims to reduce, highlighting the difference in the magnitude of the cuts proposed by Mr. Dingell and Mr. Bush.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country , sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills||The administration , , has staunchly opposed cost-sharing .||The first sentence proposes a cost-sharing mechanism to help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities, which would prevent significant increases in electricity bills for consumers.The second sentence states that the administration has strongly opposed such cost-sharing arrangements. This establishes a comparison between the proposed idea (cost-sharing mechanism) and the administration's stance (opposition to cost-sharing). The relationship is one of contrast or difference, highlighting how the administration's position differs from the proposal mentioned.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||, it might not win the support of utilities , many in the West , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels .||Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns .||The first sentence indicates there is a group of utilities that have already invested in expensive cleanup equipment or cleaner-burning fuels, suggesting they may have different perspectives or concerns regarding additional regulations.The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying actions taken by lawmakers representing these cleaner utilities. These lawmakers are working with the White House to modify the administration's bill to address their specific acid-rain concerns. This shows that the utilities' stance mentioned earlier has led to concrete legislative efforts, providing more detail on how these utilities are engaging with policy changes.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Several moves were taken following the October 1987 crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility .||On the Big Board , a `` side car '' is put into effect when the S&P futures rise or fall 12 points .||The first sentence outlines several measures taken after the 1987 crash to manage the stock and futures markets during volatile periods. The second sentence details one specific measure, the "side car" mechanism on the Big Board, which is activated based on fluctuations in S&P futures. This detail elaborates on the types of actions mentioned in the first sentence, providing a concrete example of how they manage market volatility. Thus, the second sentence expands on the information provided in the first by offering a specific instance of the measures taken.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||On the Big Board , a `` side car '' is put into effect when the S&P futures rise or fall 12 points .||The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders .||The first sentence introduces the concept of a "side car" on the Big Board, which is triggered by a 12-point rise or fall in S&P futures.The second sentence provides more detail about what happens when the side car is activated: program trades are routed into a special computer file to check for imbalances in buy and sell orders. The second sentence expands on the first by explaining how the side car mechanism works, thus providing additional information about the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , S&P 500 futures are not allowed to fall further than 12 points from the previous day 's close for half an hour .||If , when trading resumes , the S&P futures fall 30 points from the previous day 's close , a one-hour trading halt takes effect .||The first sentence outlines a rule about S&P 500 futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, stating that they cannot fall more than 12 points below the previous day's close for a half-hour period. The second sentence expands on this rule by describing what happens if trading resumes and the S&P futures drop by 30 points from the previous day's close: a one-hour trading halt is initiated. The second sentence provides additional information about the consequences of price changes, building upon the initial rule described in the first sentence. This elaboration establishes an expansion relationship between the two sentences.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||The `` Designated Order Turnaround '' System was launched by the New York Stock Exchange in March 1976 , to offer automatic , high-speed order processing||A faster version , the SuperDot , was launched in 1984 .||The first sentence states that the "Designated Order Turnaround" (DOT) system was launched by the New York Stock Exchange in March 1976 for automatic, high-speed order processing. The second sentence mentions the launch of a faster version called SuperDOT in 1984. The temporal relationship is evident as the events are sequenced in time: the DOT system was introduced first, and then, at a later point in time, the SuperDOT system was launched. This sequence establishes a temporal connection between the two sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Many investors , mainly institutions , follow an investment strategy of buying and holding a mix of stocks to match the performance of a broad stock-market barometer such as the S&P 500||Many institutional index funds are active program traders , swapping their stocks for futures when profitable to do so .||The first sentence introduces the concept of many investors, primarily institutions, adopting a buy-and-hold strategy to mirror the performance of a broad market index like the S&P 500. The second sentence expands on these institutional investors by specifying a particular activity they engage in: being active program traders who swap stocks for futures when it's profitable. This additional detail provides more information about what some of these institutional investors do, thus expanding upon the initial concept introduced in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'rather'] ||that it does n't mean Mr. Steinberg will definitely seek control||Maybe he just wants to make something happen||The first sentence indicates uncertainty about Mr. Steinberg's intentions, suggesting he may not necessarily seek control.The second sentence expands on this uncertainty by offering a possible alternative: that Mr. Steinberg's actions might simply be aimed at creating change or progress, rather than taking control. The expansion comes from providing an additional perspective on what Mr. Steinberg's intentions could be, beyond seeking control.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Mr. Steinberg may be trying to position himself as a friendly investor who could help UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf revive a failed labor-management bid||Mr. Steinberg could replace British Airways PLC , which has withdrawn from the buy-out group .||The first sentence indicates that Mr. Steinberg might be attempting to present himself as a supportive investor for UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, particularly in relation to a previously unsuccessful labor-management bid. The second sentence provides additional context by specifying a potential scenario where Mr. Steinberg could take over the role of British Airways PLC, which had previously been part of the buy-out group but has since withdrawn. This further explains how Mr. Steinberg could assist Stephen Wolf, expanding on the idea introduced in the first sentence. The second sentence offers more detail about the situation, thus creating an expansion relationship with the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Reliance had already bought and sold UAL stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $ 6.79 billion , $ 300-a-share labor-management buy-out .||Reliance acquired a 7 % UAL stake early this year at an average cost of $ 110 a share , and reduced its stake to 4.7 % after UAL accepted the bid at prices higher than $ 282 a share .||The first sentence states that Reliance made a large profit from buying and selling UAL stock before the failure of the buy-out deal. The second sentence expands on this by providing specific details about how Reliance acquired and then reduced its stake in UAL, including the price ranges and the percentage of shares involved. These details further explain how Reliance was able to make a profit, as mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the second sentence expands upon the information provided in the first one.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that Coniston Partners , a New York money manager , has bought more than 5 % of UAL stock and may challenge the UAL board 's decision last week to remain independent .||Speculation about Coniston has caused the stock to rebound from a low of $ 145 .||The first sentence introduces the idea that Coniston Partners' actions have added a new twist to market speculation regarding UAL stock. The second sentence expands on the impact of this speculation by specifying that it has caused UAL's stock price to rebound from a low point. Thus, the second sentence provides additional detail about the effect of the speculation mentioned in the first sentence, deepening our understanding of how the speculation influences the stock's value.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Synchrony', 'meanwhile'] ||UAL would n't elaborate on a statement that it had been notified of the filing by Reliance .||Reliance confirmed the filing but would n't elaborate .||In the first sentence, UAL reports that they were notified of a filing by Reliance. In the second sentence, Reliance confirms the filing but does not provide further details. The temporal relationship is evident here because Reliance's confirmation of the filing logically follows UAL's notification about it. This means that the event of Reliance confirming the filing happened after UAL was notified of it.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'earlier'] ||Mr. Steinberg is thought to be on friendly terms with UAL 's Mr. Wolf .||The investor was instrumental in tapping Mr. Wolf to run the air cargo unit of Tiger International Inc .||The first sentence states that Mr. Steinberg is believed to have a friendly relationship with Mr. Wolf from UAL. The second sentence describes Mr. Steinberg's involvement in selecting Mr. Wolf for a role at Tiger International Inc. The temporal relationship here indicates a sequence of events: first, there was the establishment of a friendly relationship between Mr. Steinberg and Mr. Wolf, and subsequently, Mr. Steinberg played a key role in Mr. Wolf's appointment at Tiger International Inc. Thus, the second event follows the first one chronologically.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The investor was instrumental in tapping Mr. Wolf to run the air cargo unit of Tiger International Inc .||Mr. Wolf 's success in that job helped him land the top job with UAL in December 1987 .||The first sentence states that the investor played a key role in selecting Mr. Wolf to lead the air cargo division of Tiger International Inc. The second sentence provides additional information about Mr. Wolf’s career trajectory, specifically mentioning that his success in the aforementioned role contributed to his appointment as the top executive at UAL in December 1987. The second sentence expands on Mr. Wolf's professional journey by detailing the outcome of his successful tenure at Tiger International Inc., thus deepening our understanding of the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Primerica , which had owned nearly 70 % of Williams , will pay about 16.7 million shares , currently valued at almost $ 472 million , for the rest of Williams .||The financial-services company will pay 0.82 share for each Williams share .||The first sentence states that Primerica will pay about 16.7 million shares, currently valued at almost $472 million, for the remaining shares of Williams that it does not already own.The second sentence provides more specific details about the terms of the payment: Primerica will pay 0.82 shares for each Williams share. This additional information expands on how Primerica is compensating Williams' shareholders, specifying the exchange ratio. Thus, the second sentence is an expansion of the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||they are meant only to benefit shareholders when `` the company is on a roll||This has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman||The first sentence states that certain actions or benefits are intended for shareholders when the company is doing well. The second sentence specifies that these actions or benefits do not apply to Marty Ackerman. The expansion relationship is demonstrated by providing additional information about who is not included in the benefits mentioned in the first sentence, thus expanding our understanding of its scope.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The prior-year period includes a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the B-1B bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business , which made net $ 185.9 million , or 70 cents a share .||Sales rose 4 % to $ 3.28 billion from $ 3.16 billion .||The first sentence provides specific details about factors affecting the financial results for the prior-year period, including a one-time favorable tax adjustment related to the B-1B bomber program and gains from the sale of the industrial sewing-machine business, which together contributed $185.9 million, or 70 cents per share, to the net income.The second sentence presents an increase in sales, which is an additional piece of information contributing to the overall financial performance of the company during the same period.The expansion relationship is demonstrated through the provision of supplementary information (sales growth) that contributes to a broader understanding of the financial context and performance during the prior-year period, complementing the specific details about income adjustments and gains.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The graphics business , , saw its operating earnings for the quarter jump 79 % to $ 42.1 million from $ 23.5 million .||For the year , , graphics earnings almost doubled .||The first sentence states that the graphics business experienced a significant increase in operating earnings for the quarter.The second sentence expands on this information by stating that the growth in earnings was even more pronounced over the entire year, with the earnings nearly doubling. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence provides additional detail about the growth trend that began in the quarter mentioned in the first sentence, extending it to cover the entire year.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as'] ||Aerospace earnings sagged 37 % for the quarter and 15 % for the year , largely due to lower B-1B program profit||the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988||The first sentence explains that there was a significant decline in aerospace earnings for both the quarter and the year, attributing it largely to lower profits from the B-1B program. The second sentence provides information about the timeline of the B-1B program, specifically mentioning that the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988. The relationship is contingent because the financial impact described in the first sentence is contingent upon the completion of the B-1B program, which is detailed in the second sentence. The financial results are dependent on the status of the B-1B program.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'although'] ||the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988||That was partially offset by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines .||The first sentence provides a specific historical context by mentioning the end of bomber production in April 1988. The second sentence discusses other events from around the same period: the resumption of space shuttle flights and a rise in demand for launch-vehicle engines. These events are compared to the end of bomber production, suggesting they had a balancing effect on the aerospace industry. By mentioning these concurrent positive developments in the aerospace sector, the text implies a comparison with the cessation of bomber production, indicating how different factors influenced the industry at that time.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||For fiscal 1989 , the company posted net of $ 734.9 million , or $ 2.87 a share , down from $ 811.9 million , or $ 3.04 a share , in fiscal 1988 .||Excluding one-time additions to profit in each year , earnings per share were $ 2.47 , up 7.4 % from $ 2.30 in fiscal 1988 .||The first sentence provides the net income figures for fiscal years 1989 and 1988, showing a decline in net income and earnings per share (EPS).The second sentence presents adjusted EPS figures for the same years, excluding one-time additions to profit, and indicates an increase in adjusted EPS from fiscal 1988 to 1989. The comparison relationship is evident as the second sentence contrasts the adjusted EPS figures, highlighting a positive change despite the overall decline in reported EPS, thereby offering a different perspective on the company's financial performance.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Excluding one-time additions to profit in each year , earnings per share were $ 2.47 , up 7.4 % from $ 2.30 in fiscal 1988 .||Sales for the year rose 5 % to $ 12.52 billion from $ 11.95 billion in fiscal 1988 .||The first sentence provides information about the earnings per share (EPS) excluding one-time additions, showing an increase from the previous fiscal year. The second sentence discusses the rise in sales for the same period. The expansion relationship is demonstrated through the presentation of related financial metrics: both EPS and sales figures have increased compared to the previous fiscal year, indicating growth in different aspects of the company's financial performance. The second sentence expands on the financial success mentioned in the first sentence by providing additional evidence of growth through increased sales.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||its price cuts include a $ 100 reduction on its System 210 computer with 512 kilobytes of memory , a 40-megabyte hard disk and a color monitor||That package now sells for about $ 2,099 .||The first sentence mentions a $100 price cut on a specific computer configuration (System 210 with 512 kilobytes of memory, a 40-megabyte hard disk, and a color monitor). The second sentence provides the new selling price of that package, which is around $2,099. The relationship is contingent because the new price ($2,099) is a direct result of the price cut mentioned in the first sentence. The second sentence depends on the information provided in the first sentence to make sense, specifically the detail about the price reduction.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||That package now sells for about $ 2,099 .||A computer using the more-advanced Intel Corp. 386 microprocessor , with four megabytes of memory and a 100-megabyte hard disk now sells for $ 5,699 , down from $ 6,799 .||The first sentence provides the price of a certain package, which is about $2,099.The second sentence gives the price of a computer with specific features ($5,699), noting that it has been reduced from $6,799. These two prices are provided in the same context, allowing for a comparison of cost between different products (a package and a computer). Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of comparison, as they both present costs of different items within the same domain (presumably technology-related products).
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The March delivery , , settled at 14.53 cents , up 0.56 cent a pound .||The May contract , , ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents .||The first sentence states that the March delivery settled at 14.53 cents, up 0.56 cent a pound. The second sentence mentions the May contract ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents. The comparison relationship is evident as both sentences present data points (price changes for different delivery months) that can be compared. Specifically, the March delivery had a higher settlement price and a slightly larger increase than the May contract. This comparison allows readers to understand the relative performance of the two contracts.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The May contract , , ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents .||The July delivery rose its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cent a pound to 14.00 cents , .||The first sentence states that the May contract gained 0.54 cents, ending at 14.26 cents. The second sentence describes the July delivery, which rose by its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cents to reach 14.00 cents. The comparison relationship is evident because both sentences discuss gains in value for different contracts (May and July). They are compared through their respective gains and final values, highlighting the similarities in their price movements.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||that 65 % or more of Brazil 's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and ca n't use gasoline||This is a demand that must be met , regardless of the price of oil ,||The first sentence presents a fact about Brazil's automotive market, specifically that over 65% of new cars run on alcohol and cannot use gasoline. The second sentence introduces a requirement or perspective that this situation must be accommodated, no matter the cost of oil. The contingency relationship is evident because the necessity expressed in the second sentence (meeting the demand for alcohol-fueled cars) is contingent upon the fact presented in the first sentence (the prevalence of such vehicles). The second sentence's demand is directly responsive to the first sentence's condition.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||During the current crop year , Brazil was expected to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar , a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988-89 .||Its 1989-90 exports were expected to total 645,000 tons in contrast to shipments of 1.5 million tons in||The first sentence provides information about Brazil's sugar production for the current crop year, noting a decrease from the previous year (1988-89).The second sentence expands upon this context by providing additional details about Brazil's expected exports for the same period (1989-90) and comparing them to the previous year's exports. This expansion of information further illustrates the reduction in sugar output and its impact on export figures.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||It is these 645,000 tons that are in question for this crop year||`` Producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued '' yesterday .||The first sentence states that there is uncertainty or scrutiny around 645,000 tons of sugar for the current crop year. The second sentence provides context about the producers being granted the right to ship sugar and the expectation of export licenses being issued. The contingency relationship exists because the issuance of export licenses (second sentence) is dependent on or related to the status of the 645,000 tons of sugar in question (first sentence). The right to ship and the expectation of license issuance are actions taken in relation to the sugar whose status is uncertain, suggesting a contingent relationship where one event depends on the other.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||that little or no sugar from the 1989-90 crop has been shipped yet , even though the crop year is six months old||More than a half of all sugar produced in Brazil goes for alcohol production , according to Ms. Ganes .||The first sentence indicates that there has been minimal shipment of sugar from the 1989-90 crop despite it being halfway through the crop year. The second sentence, provided by Ms. Ganes, explains that over half of Brazil's sugar production is used for alcohol production. This information helps understand why there might be limited sugar shipments, as much of the sugar is directed towards alcohol production instead of being shipped out. Therefore, the fact provided by Ms. Ganes (about sugar usage for alcohol production) is contingent upon the situation described in the first sentence (limited sugar shipments).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Above all the situation is extremely confused .||Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation||The first sentence states that the situation is extremely confused. The second sentence expands on this confusion by providing a specific example: professional sugar people with strong contacts to the Brazilian sugar industry are unable to confirm reports or get enough information. This further illustrates the overall confusion mentioned in the first sentence, thus creating an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation||`` It 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out , such as the one saying exports will be suspended , and no one can confirm it . ''||The first sentence states that professionals with strong contacts to the Brazilian sugar industry cannot confirm reports or get enough information. The second sentence provides context for why this is happening: there's a nervous atmosphere where reports circulate without confirmation. This second sentence expands on the first by explaining the environment that leads to the uncertainty described in the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Mexico , which is normally a sugar exporter , has had production problems in the past two years||Last year , it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments||The first sentence states that Mexico, typically a sugar exporter, faced production issues over the past two years. The second sentence provides a specific instance of the consequences of those production problems: Mexico had to import sugar to fulfill its export obligations. The second sentence expands on the first by offering a detailed example of the production problems mentioned, thus deepening our understanding of the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Last year , it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments||This year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs||The first sentence states that last year, the subject (presumably a country or organization) had to purchase sugar on the world market to fulfill its export obligations. The second sentence expands on this situation by providing more details for the current year: it is expected to become a net importer and is looking to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar for domestic use. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence builds upon the information presented in the first, adding specifics about the current year's situation.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way .||On the New York Mercantile Exchange , heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon .||The first sentence states that petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way. The second sentence provides specific details about the increase in heating oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange, including the exact price change and settlement value. This detailed information expands on the initial statement about heating oil leading the gains in petroleum futures, providing more concrete evidence and context for the claim. Thus, the second sentence offers an expansion of the information presented in the first sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||On the New York Mercantile Exchange , heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon .||Gasoline futures were mixed to unchanged .||The first sentence provides information about the change in price for heating oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, noting a specific increase and the new settlement price. The second sentence discusses gasoline futures, stating they were "mixed to unchanged." The comparison relationship is evident because both sentences describe the changes (or lack thereof) in prices for related commodities (heating oil and gasoline) within the same context (futures market). The comparison highlights the difference in market behavior between heating oil and gasoline futures.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||But the strength in heating oil helped push up crude oil .||West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents a barrel to settle at $ 20.07 .||The first sentence indicates that the strength in heating oil prices had an upward effect on crude oil prices.The second sentence gives a specific instance of this effect: the price of West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery increased by 13 cents a barrel to settle at $20.07. The second sentence expands on the first by providing concrete details about the rise in crude oil prices that were mentioned more generally in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come .||Trading was muted in part because of the observance of All Saints ' Day across much of Europe .||The first sentence states that prices closed mostly higher due to farmers withholding their crops from the marketplace for better future prices. The second sentence adds another reason for the trading being muted: the observance of All Saints' Day across much of Europe. The second sentence expands on the context provided in the first sentence by providing an additional contributing factor to the trading conditions described.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Trading was muted in part because of the observance of All Saints ' Day across much of Europe .||Continued export demand also supported prices .||The first sentence explains that trading was muted due to the observance of All Saints' Day in much of Europe. The second sentence introduces another factor that influenced the market, which is continued export demand supporting prices. Both sentences provide reasons for the observed market conditions, with the second sentence expanding on the factors at play by adding information about export demand. Thus, the relationship is one of expansion, where additional context is provided to further explain the situation.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Continued export demand also supported prices .||As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S. , that late Tuesday the Chinese government , which often buys U.S. grains in quantity , turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat .||The first sentence states that continued export demand supported prices. The second sentence provides additional context by explaining a specific scenario where the Chinese government, due to the tight grain supply situation in the U.S., decided to purchase wheat from Britain instead. This scenario exemplifies the tight supply situation mentioned in the first sentence and expands upon the concept of how export demand can influence market dynamics, supporting the assertion about continued export demand affecting prices. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by providing a specific instance that illustrates the broader point.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S.||That designation would , among other things , provide more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain .||The first sentence indicates that prices were supported by rumors of the Soviet Union receiving most favored nation status from the U.S. The second sentence explains one consequence of this status, which is more generous credit terms for purchasing grain. Here, the contingency relationship is demonstrated by the fact that the effect on prices (support) is contingent upon the rumored status, and the specific benefit (credit terms for grain purchase) is contingent upon the status being granted. The potential change in trade conditions is a direct result of the rumored policy change, illustrating the contingent nature of the relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Futures prices rose , extending Tuesday 's gains .||The December contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $ 1.1650 .||The first sentence states that futures prices rose, continuing the gains from the previous day (Tuesday). The second sentence gives more specific information about one particular contract, the December contract, detailing exactly how much it advanced (2.50 cents a pound to $1.1650). The second sentence expands on the first by providing specifics (the type of contract and the exact price change) that support the general statement made in the first sentence about rising futures prices.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began||According to news service reports , most workers at the Disputado mines owned by Exxon Corp. agreed to a new two-year wage contract that includes a 5 % increase and other benefits .||The first sentence indicates that traders disregarded news about a potential mine strike in Chile that ended quickly. The second sentence provides additional details about the situation at the Disputado mines owned by Exxon Corp., specifically mentioning that most workers agreed to a new wage contract with specific terms (a 5% increase and other benefits). This additional information expands upon the initial statement by giving more context about what happened at the mines, thus explaining why the traders might have considered the news unimportant. The relationship is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds depth and detail to the first.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||Younkers management is likely to buy a 10 % to 20 % interest in the chain in January||Equitable hopes to eventually reduce its stake in Younkers to less than 50 %||The first sentence indicates that Younkers' management plans to purchase a significant interest in the company, suggesting a change in ownership structure. The second sentence reveals Equitable's goal to decrease its own stake in Younkers. These actions are related because as Younkers' management buys into the company, it allows for other stakeholders, like Equitable, to proportionally reduce their holdings. Thus, the expansion of one party's ownership (Younkers' management) logically leads to the reduction of another's (Equitable), making the relationship between the sentences one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||his departure was for `` personal reasons , '' which he declined to specify||There is no business reason for my departure , '' nor any disagreement over policy||The first sentence states that the departure was for personal reasons, which were unspecified. The second sentence further clarifies that there is no business reason for the departure and no disagreement over policy. This additional information expands upon the initial statement by providing more context and specifying what the reasons for departure are not (i.e., not business-related or due to policy disagreements). Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by adding detail about the nature of the personal reasons mentioned.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects `` no change in strategy or profits . ''||Mark Shepperd , an analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew in London , said , `` I suspect the departure will be fairly irrelevant for the company .||The first sentence includes a statement from a Reuters spokesman asserting that the departure does not signify any change in strategy or profits. The second sentence presents the viewpoint of Mark Shepperd, an analyst, who suspects that the departure will be fairly irrelevant for the company. Both statements share the perspective that the departure is unlikely to impact the company significantly. Thus, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first by providing additional support from an independent source, reinforcing the notion that the departure is not expected to affect the company's strategy or profitability.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||I suspect the departure will be fairly irrelevant for the company||I would be very surprised if his departure signals any change in strategy or change in profit expectations . ''||The first sentence suggests that the speaker believes the departure will not significantly impact the company. The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying what aspects of the company the speaker thinks will remain unaffected: strategy and profit expectations. The use of "I would be very surprised" reinforces the initial sentiment that the departure is expected to be irrelevant, providing additional detail to support the original claim.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||On London 's Stock Exchange , Reuters shares rose five pence to 913 pence $ 14.43 .||In the U.S. over-the-counter market , American depositary shares for Reuters , each representing three shares in the London market , closed unchanged at $ 43.875 .||The first sentence provides information about the price movement of Reuters shares on London's Stock Exchange. The second sentence describes the performance of American depositary shares (ADS) for Reuters in the U.S. over-the-counter market. The relationship is comparative because the two sentences contrast the rise in share price in London with the unchanged price of ADS in the U.S. This comparison highlights different outcomes in two separate markets for related financial instruments.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The senior of the three executives who will assume Mr. Reupke 's duties is Nigel Judah , 58 , finance director and a Reuters board director .||Peter Holland , 45 , deputy general manager , becomes director of corporate affairs .||The first sentence introduces the senior of the three executives who will take on Mr. Reupke's duties, naming Nigel Judah and providing his roles and details. The second sentence provides more information about another one of these executives, Peter Holland, detailing his new position. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the group of executives mentioned in the first sentence by giving specific details about Peter Holland.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Dunkin' is based in Randolph , Mass .||Cara , a food services chain operator and Unicorp , a holding company , are based in Toronto .||The first sentence states that Dunkin' is based in Randolph, Massachusetts. The second sentence mentions Cara, a food services chain operator, and Unicorp, a holding company, both being based in Toronto. These two sentences establish a comparison by providing information about the locations of different companies. Specifically, it compares the location of Dunkin' with the locations of Cara and Unicorp, highlighting that while Dunkin' is based in Massachusetts, the other two companies are based in Toronto. This comparison allows readers to understand the geographic distribution of these businesses.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||in addition , the loss was magnified by nonrecurring charges totaling $ 23.5 million and $ 8.2 million in asset-valuation adjustments that he described as `` unusual||The charges were partly offset by a $ 2 million gain on the sale of investments of two joint ventures||The first sentence introduces a significant loss for the company, with nonrecurring charges and asset-valuation adjustments described as unusual. The second sentence then mentions a $2 million gain from the sale of investments in two joint ventures. This gain serves as a comparison to the losses mentioned previously, indicating that while the company experienced substantial losses, there was also a positive financial event (the gain) that partially offset those losses. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of comparison, showing how the gain relates to the magnitude of the losses.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Revenue declined 8 % to $ 85.7 million , from $ 93.3 million a year earlier .||`` a general softening in the demand for office products in the market segments in which Savin competes .||The first sentence indicates a decline in revenue for Savin.The second sentence provides a reason for this decline: a general softening in the demand for office products in the market segments where Savin operates. Therefore, the decrease in revenue is contingent upon the reduced demand for office products in its market, establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between the two sentences.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Synchrony', 'meanwhile'] ||Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index added 0.84 to 341.20 ; the rise was equivalent to a gain of about six points in the industrial average .||The Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 0.99 to 319.75 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index went up 0.60 to 188.84 .||The first sentence states that the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index increased by 0.84 to reach 341.20, and it also mentions the equivalent gain in the industrial average. The second sentence describes movements in other market indices: the Dow Jones Equity Market Index and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, both of which also experienced gains. The temporal relationship indicates that these events (the changes in the various stock indices) happened in succession, but they are not explicitly ordered. It can be inferred that all these changes occurred around the same time, likely during the same trading day.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||The October survey of corporate purchasing managers , as expected , provided evidence that economic growth remains subdued .||An index of economic activity drawn from the survey stood last month at 47.6 %||The first sentence states that the October survey of corporate purchasing managers, as expected, showed that economic growth remains subdued. The second sentence provides more specific information related to the survey by stating that an index of economic activity from this survey stood at 47.6% last month. This percentage further explains the subdued economic growth mentioned in the first sentence, thus expanding upon the initial statement with additional detail.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||This market 's still going through its pains||`` The psychology is still : ` We want stocks up , but if they do n't carry we 're going to sell them . ' ''||The first sentence states that the market is still experiencing difficulties.The second sentence expands on this idea by providing more detail about the current investor sentiment: They want stocks to rise, but are prepared to sell if they don't. It explains why the market may be going through its "pains" - due to the uncertain and cautious attitude of investors. The second sentence provides additional context and elaboration on the state of the market, deepening our understanding of the situation described in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Trading is expected to remain subdued as the market awaits tomorrow 's release of the jobs data with the hope that it will point toward a decline in interest rates .||that some people are reluctant to stick their necks out in any aggressive way until after the figures come out||The first sentence states that trading is expected to remain subdued while the market waits for jobs data, hoping it indicates lower interest rates. The second sentence explains one reason for this behavior: some people are hesitant to make aggressive moves before seeing the data. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by providing a specific reason for the subdued trading activity. The detail about people being reluctant to act aggressively further clarifies why the trading is expected to remain subdued, establishing an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Campbell Soup jumped 3 3/8 to 47 1/8 as the resignation of R. Gordon McGovern as president and chief executive officer sparked a revival of rumors that the company could become a takeover target .||Prudential-Bache Securities boosted the stock 's short-term investment rating in response to the departure||The first sentence states that Campbell Soup's stock price increased significantly following the resignation of its president and CEO, R. Gordon McGovern, and that this event revived takeover rumors. The second sentence explains that Prudential-Bache Securities raised the stock's short-term investment rating in response to McGovern's departure. The relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, as the second sentence provides additional information about how the market reacted to the news of McGovern's resignation. Specifically, it details a specific action taken by a financial firm in response to the event mentioned in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Prudential-Bache Securities boosted the stock 's short-term investment rating in response to the departure||the company will turn to new management `` that 's more financially oriented||The first part of the sentence indicates that Prudential-Bache Securities raised the stock's short-term investment rating. The second part explains the reason for this action: the company will have new management that is more financially oriented. The contingency relationship is evident because the action taken by Prudential-Bache Securities (boosting the stock's rating) is directly linked to the expected change in management. The rating boost is contingent upon the anticipation of improved financial management.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Upjohn , a rumored target within the drug industry , advanced 7/8 to 38 7/8 .||it plans a fourth-quarter charge , , for an early-retirement program||The first sentence discusses Upjohn, a company rumored to be a target within the drug industry, and its stock price advancing by 7/8 to 38 7/8.The second sentence introduces a plan for a fourth-quarter charge related to an early-retirement program. However, there is no direct comparison between the two sentences; instead, they both provide separate pieces of information about the company Upjohn. As such, the relationship cannot be classified as a direct comparison. The provided relationship label seems incorrect based on the content of the sentences.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Great Northern Nekoosa , which surged 20 1/8 Tuesday after Georgia-Pacific launched a $ 3.18 billion offer for the company , dropped 1 3/8 to 61 1/2 in Big Board composite trading of 5.1 million shares .||Georgia-Pacific , which went down 2 1/2 Tuesday , lost another 1/2 to 50 3/8 .||The first sentence describes the stock movement of Great Northern Nekoosa following an acquisition offer from Georgia-Pacific. It experienced a significant surge but then dropped in value. The second sentence discusses the stock movement of Georgia-Pacific, which had already gone down and continued to lose value. The comparison relationship is evident as both sentences detail the stock performance of two related companies (Great Northern Nekoosa and Georgia-Pacific) in the context of the acquisition offer, highlighting how each company's stock was affected over time.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Other paper and forest-products stocks closed mixed .||Mead rose 3/4 to 39 1/2 , Federal Paper Board added 1/2 to 24 3/8 and Scott Paper gained 1/2 to 48 3/8 , while International Paper fell 7/8 to 48 7/8 , Champion International lost 3/8 to 31 1/2 and Louisiana-Pacific dropped 1/8 to 40 1/4 .||The first sentence states that other paper and forest-products stocks closed mixed, indicating a variety of changes in stock prices within the sector. The second sentence provides specific examples of how certain companies' stocks changed: some increased (Mead, Federal Paper Board, and Scott Paper), while others decreased (International Paper, Champion International, and Louisiana-Pacific). This detailed information expands upon the initial statement about mixed results, offering concrete evidence of the varied performance. Therefore, the second sentence has an expansion relationship with the first one, providing more details to support the mixed outcome mentioned.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Most of the volume came from trades designed to capture the stock 's next dividend||Texaco has a yield of 5.6 % and goes ex-dividend today||The first sentence indicates that a significant portion of trading activity (volume) was driven by trades aimed at securing the stock's upcoming dividend. The second sentence provides specific information about Texaco's dividend, including its yield and the fact that it goes ex-dividend today. The contingency relationship is evident because the high trading volume (first sentence) is contingent upon the upcoming dividend (second sentence). Traders were likely buying the stock specifically to receive the dividend, which explains the increased trading activity.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'since'] ||Santa Fe Pacific dropped 1 1/8 to 17 3/4 .||The company 's proposal to sell a 20 % stake in its real-estate unit for around $ 400 million has caused analysts to consider whether to cut their estimates of Santa Fe 's asset value .||The first sentence indicates that Santa Fe Pacific's stock price fell. The second sentence explains one reason for this drop: the company's proposal to sell a stake in its real-estate unit, which has led analysts to reconsider their estimates of the company's asset value. Thus, the proposal and its effect on analyst opinions are contingent upon the change in stock price, suggesting a causal link between the two events. The drop in stock price is contingent on the company's proposal and the subsequent reevaluation by analysts.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'after'] ||GenCorp tumbled 2 to 14 .||The company forecast that fourth-quarter income from continuing operations would be `` significantly '' lower than a year earlier .||The first sentence states that GenCorp's stock price fell to 14, decreasing by 2.The second sentence provides information about the company forecasting a significantly lower income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year. While the relationship marked is 'Temporal,' the provided sentences do not directly indicate a temporal sequence between the events. Instead, they suggest a causal connection where the drop in stock price may be due to the company's forecast. However, following the instruction to explain the given relationship, we can infer that the announcement of the forecast might have happened before or around the time of the stock price drop, potentially causing the decrease. Thus, there is an implied temporal sequence where the company's forecast precedes or coincides with the stock price change.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'since'] ||Allergan went up 1/2 to 19 3/8 .||The Food and Drug Administration allowed the company to begin marketing a new lens for use in cataract patients .||The first sentence indicates that Allergan's stock price increased. The second sentence provides information about an event that could affect the company's stock price: the FDA allowed the company to market a new lens for cataract patients. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the stock price movement (in the first sentence) is likely contingent upon, or influenced by, the news of the FDA's approval (in the second sentence).
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as'] ||Old Spaghetti Warehouse rose 1 to 16 1/8 .||Its net income for the September quarter rose about 41 % from a year ago .||The first sentence indicates that the stock price of Old Spaghetti Warehouse increased. The second sentence provides information about the company's net income for the September quarter increasing by approximately 41% from the previous year. The rise in net income could be a reason for the increase in the stock price, suggesting that the stock price increase is contingent upon the positive financial results. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the financial performance may have led to the change in the stock price.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||it will convert its Freeport-McMoRan Energy Partners Ltd. partnership into a publicly traded company through the exchange of units of the partnership for common shares||the restructuring is n't expected to have any impact , adverse or otherwise , on its financial results||The first sentence outlines the action of converting the Freeport-McMoRan Energy Partners Ltd. partnership into a publicly traded company. The second sentence compares the expected impact of this action on financial results to a neutral outcome, stating there will be no adverse or otherwise significant impact. The comparison relationship is established by evaluating the effect of the conversion against potential changes in financial outcomes.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||the partnership will exchange its assets for common shares of a yet-to-be-formed entity||Freeport-McMoRan Energy Partners will be liquidated and shares of the new company distributed to the partnership 's unitholders .||The first sentence outlines the basic plan for the partnership to exchange its assets for shares in a new entity. The second sentence expands on this plan by providing more specific details about how this exchange will occur: Freeport-McMoRan Energy Partners will be liquidated, and the new company's shares will be distributed to the partnership's unitholders. The second sentence adds depth to the first one, explaining the process and who will receive the shares, thus forming an expansionary relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Unitholders will receive two additional 55 cents-a-unit distribution payments before the trust is liquidated in early 1990||that common shares equal to the number of units outstanding -- -- will be issued during the first quarter of 1990||The first sentence states that unitholders will receive two more distribution payments before the trust is liquidated in early 1990. The second sentence provides further details about the actions planned for the first quarter of 1990, specifically mentioning the issuance of common shares equal to the number of units outstanding. This additional information expands upon the timeline and specific actions taking place around the same time as the final distributions, thus creating an expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||that the parent concern 's pretax earnings in the first half ended last Sept. 30 rose 14 % to 88.32 billion yen $ 618.1 million from 77.6 billion yen a year earlier||strong domestic sales against the backdrop of continuous economic expansion .||The first sentence states that the parent company's pretax earnings increased by 14% during the first half of the fiscal year ending September 30. The second sentence discusses strong domestic sales due to ongoing economic expansion. The contingency relationship is evident here because the strong domestic sales, which contributed to the rise in earnings, are contingent upon the continuous economic expansion. In other words, the growth in earnings (first sentence) is explained by the context provided in the second sentence (strong sales due to economic expansion).
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||it will exchange one share of a new preferred stock for each POP common share it does n't already own||Depending upon how many warrants and options are exercised prior to completion of the transaction , Heritage would issue between 1.8 million and 2.35 million preferred shares||The first sentence outlines the terms of an exchange involving a new preferred stock for each POP common share not currently owned. The second sentence explains that the number of preferred shares issued by Heritage will depend on the number of warrants and options exercised before the transaction is completed. The contingency here lies in the fact that the exact number of preferred shares to be issued hinges on the number of warrants and options exercised, making the quantity of shares issued contingent upon those exercises.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||profit for the quarter rose 1.1 % to $ 93.9 million , or $ 1.19 a share , compared with $ 92.9 million , or $ 1.18 a share , the year earlier||The results reflected a 24 % gain in income from its finance businesses , and a 15 % slide in income from insurance operations .||The first sentence states that the profit for the quarter increased by 1.1% to $93.9 million, or $1.19 a share, compared to $92.9 million, or $1.18 a share, in the previous year. The second sentence breaks down the factors contributing to this change by mentioning a 24% increase in income from finance businesses and a 15% decrease in income from insurance operations. This breakdown provides more specific information about the components that led to the overall profit change, thus expanding on the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||third-quarter investment gains were $ 10.2 million , compared with $ 6.4 million the year earlier||insurance profit reflected a $ 6 million loss from Hurricane Hugo||The first sentence provides information about the third-quarter investment gains, comparing the current year's figure ($10.2 million) to the previous year's figure ($6.4 million).The second sentence details a specific factor impacting the overall profit, which is a $6 million loss due to Hurricane Hugo. This information expands on the context of the investment gains by providing a reason for any difference in profit expectations. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds more detail to the financial situation described in the first sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'although'] ||RMS said it had a loss of $ 158,666 , or 10 cents a share , in the third quarter , compared with a year-earlier loss of $ 26,956 , or two cents a share .||Sales rose to $ 3 million from $ 2.9 million .||The first sentence states the loss RMS experienced in the third quarter and compares it to the loss in the previous year's same period. The second sentence discusses the change in sales figures over a similar timeframe. The comparison relationship is evident in the context of financial performance over time; while the losses are compared directly, the increase in sales can be contrasted with the increasing losses, suggesting a scenario where sales growth isn't offsetting the growing operational losses. This relationship highlights the comparison between financial indicators (losses and sales) across two different periods.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'although'] ||For the nine months , the company reported a net loss of $ 608,413 , or 39 cents a share , compared with year-earlier net income of $ 967,809 , or 62 cents a share .||Sales rose to $ 9.8 million from $ 8.9 million .||The first sentence provides information about the company's net loss for the nine months, along with the comparison to the previous year's net income. The second sentence discusses the increase in sales over the same period. A comparison relationship exists because the financial figures (loss and income) are juxtaposed with the sales figures. The comparison highlights the change in the company's financial state, showing a decline in profitability despite an increase in sales.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||That amount is convertible into shares of Meridian common stock at $ 2 a share during its one-year term .||The loan may be extended by the McAlpine group for an additional year with an increase in the conversion price to $ 2.50 a share .||The first sentence states the terms of the loan conversion at $2 a share for one year. The second sentence expands upon the original statement by providing additional information about the possibility of extending the loan for another year with a higher conversion price ($2.50 a share). This additional detail broadens the understanding of the loan's terms, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The acquisition of 87-store Weisfield 's raises Ratners 's U.S. presence to 450 stores .||About 30 % of Ratners 's profit already is derived from the U.S. .||The first sentence indicates that Ratners has acquired Weisfield's, which adds 87 stores to its existing portfolio, increasing its total to 450 U.S. stores. This shows growth or expansion in terms of store count. The second sentence provides information about Ratners' profit, stating that around 30% already comes from the U.S. market. The expansion relationship is evident because the acquisition (an increase in physical presence) logically aligns with the company's existing reliance on the U.S. for a significant portion of its profits. The acquisition likely aims to further expand this profitable segment of its business.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||Yesterday , Carnival said a new company has been formed in Finland that will carry on Waertsilae 's shipbuilding operations .||Carnival said it will be an 11 % shareholder in the new company .||In the first sentence, it is mentioned that a new company has been formed in Finland to continue the shipbuilding operations previously handled by Waertsilae. The second sentence provides additional information about Carnival's involvement, specifically stating that they will hold an 11% share in this new entity. The relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion because the second sentence builds upon the information provided in the first by detailing Carnival's specific role or stake in the newly formed company.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'previously'] ||A second ship is now expected to be delivered late next year or early in 1991 .||Carnival had expected that ship to be delivered next fall .||The first sentence states that a second ship is now expected to be delivered late next year or early in 1991. The second sentence provides information about when Carnival had originally expected the ship to be delivered, which is next fall. The temporal relationship here is established by the difference in the expected delivery times. The original expectation (next fall) comes before the revised timeline (late next year or early 1991). Thus, the two sentences are related temporally, with the second sentence providing context for when the expectation for delivery was set in relation to the current expectation.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||The bulk of the pretax charge is a $ 62 million write-off of capitalized servicing at the mobile home financing subsidiary , which the company said had been a big drain on earnings .||the one-time provision would substantially eliminate all future losses at the unit||In the first sentence, the detail provided is about a $62 million write-off at the mobile home financing subsidiary, which is described as a significant negative impact on earnings. In the second sentence, the one-time provision is mentioned to substantially eliminate all future losses at the unit. The comparison relationship is established through the contrast between the financial burden of the subsidiary (as detailed in the first sentence) and the expected elimination of future losses due to the one-time provision (as stated in the second sentence). This comparison highlights the anticipated positive effect of the provision on the subsidiary's financial performance.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Synchrony', 'meanwhile'] ||Valley Federal is currently being examined by regulators .||New loans continue to slow||The first sentence states that Valley Federal is currently under examination by regulators.The second sentence discusses the ongoing situation with new loans continuing to slow down. The temporal relationship is evident here because both actions (the examination by regulators and the slowing of new loans) are happening concurrently or one after the other, indicating a sequence of events over time.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||New loans continue to slow||they were $ 6.6 million in the quarter compared with $ 361.8 million a year ago||The first sentence states that new loans continue to slow, indicating a decrease in new loan activity. The second sentence provides specific numbers to quantify this slowdown: new loans were $6.6 million in the recent quarter, compared to $361.8 million a year ago. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence expands on the first by giving concrete data that supports the claim of slowing new loans. It offers additional information to clarify the extent of the slowdown.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||it will eliminate the 13 management positions of the former Midwest Financial parent company||some of the managers will take other jobs with First of America||The first sentence states that 13 management positions from the former Midwest Financial parent company will be eliminated. The second sentence tells us that some of these managers will take other jobs within First of America. While the two sentences provide information about the fate of the management positions and the managers themselves, they do not explicitly compare or contrast. However, implicitly, the second sentence can be seen as a form of comparison as it contrasts the elimination of positions with the continuation of some managers' careers within the same organization, suggesting a different outcome for the individuals involved compared to the outright elimination of their positions. This establishes a comparative relationship between the two sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The Nicaraguan president , , suspended a 19-month-old cease-fire and accused Bush of `` promoting death . ''||While he reaffirmed support for the country 's Feb. 25 elections , Ortega indicated that renewed U.S. military aid to the Contras could thwart the balloting .||In the first sentence, the Nicaraguan president suspends the cease-fire and accuses Bush of promoting death.In the second sentence, more context is provided regarding the Nicaraguan president's stance, specifically how he views potential renewed U.S. military aid to the Contras and its impact on the upcoming elections. This additional information expands on the Nicaraguan president's position and concerns, explaining further implications of his accusations against Bush. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information presented in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Alternative', 'instead'] ||that renewed U.S. military aid to the Contras could thwart the balloting||U.S. assistance should be used to demobilize the rebels||The first sentence states that renewed U.S. military aid to the Contras could prevent the elections from happening. The second sentence expands on how the U.S. assistance should be used - in this case, to demobilize the rebels, which aligns with the idea of preventing the Contras' activities through different means (military aid versus demobilization). The expansion comes in the form of specifying an alternative use for the assistance that supports the broader goal mentioned in the first sentence.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||He said U.S. assistance should be used to demobilize the rebels .||A White House spokesman condemned the truce suspension as `` deplorable '' but brushed off talk of renewing military funding for the insurgents .||In the first sentence, the subject (presumably someone in a position of authority) suggests using U.S. assistance to demobilize the rebels. This sets a context where there is a discussion about the use of aid rather than military intervention. In the second sentence, a White House spokesman comments on the situation after the fact, specifically condemning the suspension of the truce and dismissing the idea of renewing military funding for the insurgents. The temporal relationship here is established by the sequence of events: the suggestion about U.S. assistance comes before the White House's response. The second event (the White House's condemnation and stance) occurs after the first event (the suggestion about assistance).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Health officials plan to extend a moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants .||The assistant HHS secretary said the ban `` should be continued indefinitely . ''||The first sentence states that health officials intend to prolong a moratorium on federal funding for research involving fetal-tissue transplants. The second sentence provides more detail about the duration of this planned extension, specifically mentioning that the assistant HHS secretary believes the ban should be continued indefinitely. The second sentence expands on the information from the first by specifying who holds this view and what their stance is regarding the duration of the moratorium.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||the ban `` should be continued indefinitely||While researchers believe such transplants could help treat diseases like Alzheimer 's , anti-abortionists oppose the research .||The first sentence presents a stance that the ban should be continued indefinitely.The second sentence provides context for why such a view might exist: there are anti-abortionists who oppose the research. The position to continue the ban indefinitely is contingent upon the opposition from anti-abortionists, suggesting that the ban's continuation is influenced by their opposition.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||South Africa accused armed Namibian nationalist guerrillas of crossing from bases in neighboring Angola , .||South African troops were placed on alert .||The first sentence states that South Africa has accused Namibian nationalist guerrillas of crossing from bases in Angola. The second sentence indicates that South African troops were put on alert. It is reasonable to infer that the alert status of the troops is contingent upon the accusation of the guerrilla crossings, suggesting that the action taken (placing troops on alert) is a direct response to the perceived threat (the guerrillas crossing the border).
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||South African troops were placed on alert .||Guerrilla leaders said Pretoria was attempting to sabotage next week 's elections in Namibia .||The two sentences do not present a direct comparison between elements. Instead, they present two separate pieces of information: one about South African troops being placed on alert and another about guerrilla leaders' accusations that Pretoria is trying to sabotage elections in Namibia. There is no explicit comparison made between the subjects or actions in the two sentences, so the relationship does not fit the category of Comparison. A more accurate explanation would not categorize this relationship as comparative.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Mexico 's President Salinas said the country 's recession had ended and the economy was growing again .||In his first state of the nation address , Salinas pledged to continue his program of modernization and warned opposition politicians that impeding progress could cost them popular support .||In the first sentence, President Salinas declares that Mexico's recession has ended and the economy is recovering. The second sentence elaborates on this context by providing additional information about the setting (his first state of the nation address) and further details about his plans and warnings to opposition politicians. This additional information expands on the context of the economic situation and Salinas' position, hence the expansion relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Pakistan 's Bhutto defeated the first no-confidence motion in the nation 's 42-year history , .||The prime minister 's opponents claimed the balloting , , was rigged .||The first sentence states that Bhutto defeated a no-confidence motion, which is a significant event in Pakistan's history. The second sentence mentions claims by the prime minister's opponents that the balloting was rigged. The comparison relationship can be explained as follows: The claims of rigging by Bhutto's opponents are compared against the outcome of the no-confidence motion, suggesting a contrast between the official result and the allegations of foul play. The comparison highlights the discrepancy between the historic victory and the accusations, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the event.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Pan Am has subpoenaed several government agencies , including the CIA and FBI , to determine whether they were warned that a bomb had been planted aboard a jet that exploded over Scotland last December , killing 270 people .||The airline is attempting to show that Israel and West Germany warned the U.S. about the impending attack .||The first sentence states that Pan Am has subpoenaed several government agencies, including the CIA and FBI, to find out if they were warned about a bomb planted on a flight that exploded over Scotland. The second sentence explains that the airline is trying to prove that Israel and West Germany had warned the U.S. about the imminent attack. The subpoena action taken by Pan Am is contingent upon their attempt to establish that warnings were indeed provided to the U.S. by other countries. This establishes a relationship where the action of subpoenaing is dependent on the goal of demonstrating that external warnings were communicated.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'although'] ||Still unresolved is Sony 's effort to hire producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber to run the studio .||Sony 's planned acquisition of Guber/Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million is scheduled to close Monday .||The first sentence discusses Sony's ongoing effort to hire Jon Peters and Peter Guber to manage the studio.The second sentence mentions Sony's planned acquisition of Guber/Peters Entertainment Co. for $200 million, which is set to finalize on Monday. The comparison relationship here is not directly explicit but suggests a parallel action involving the same parties (Sony and the producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber). Both sentences discuss different aspects of Sony's engagement with Peters and Guber: one is about hiring them to run the studio, and the other is about acquiring their company. These sentences are compared to provide context on Sony's interactions with the producers through different means (employment and acquisition).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Komatsu Ltd. , a large integrated maker of construction machinery , posted a 32 % unconsolidated gain in first-half pretax profit .||For the period ended Sept.30 , it earned 16.68 billion yen , US$ 116.7 million up from 12.68 billion yen the year before .||The first sentence states that Komatsu Ltd., a company in the construction machinery sector, saw a 32% increase in unconsolidated first-half pretax profit. The second sentence provides specific details about the financial results for the period ending September 30: the company earned 16.68 billion yen (US$116.7 million), up from 12.68 billion yen the previous year. This information expands on the initial statement by offering concrete numbers and a timeframe, thus explaining the extent of the profit growth mentioned.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Sales rose 11 % to 292.32 billion yen from 263.07 billion yen .||Net income surged 31 % to 7.63 billion yen from 5.82 billion yen .||The first sentence states that sales increased by 11% to reach 292.32 billion yen from 263.07 billion yen.The second sentence indicates that net income increased by 31% to 7.63 billion yen from 5.82 billion yen.Both sentences present increases, but the comparison relationship is evident in the different percentages of increase (11% for sales and 31% for net income). This allows for a comparison of the growth rates between sales and net income, showing that while both experienced growth, net income grew at a significantly higher rate.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Net income surged 31 % to 7.63 billion yen from 5.82 billion yen .||Per-share net rose to 7.84 yen from 6.53 yen .||The first sentence states that the net income increased by 31% to reach 7.63 billion yen from 5.82 billion yen. The second sentence details that per-share net rose to 7.84 yen from 6.53 yen. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence provides additional information that complements the first one, specifically how the increase in net income affects the per-share net, thus expanding on the financial performance details.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Domestic sales of construction machinery , such as power shovels and bulldozers rose to 142.84 billion yen from 126.15 billion yen .||Demand from Europe and Southeast Asia also grew , but due to increasing production at local plants , overseas sales edged down 2.8 % .||The first sentence states that domestic sales of construction machinery increased to a specific amount from a previous amount. The second sentence discusses the growth in demand from Europe and Southeast Asia but also notes a decrease in overseas sales. These two sentences form a comparison as they both present data related to sales (one domestically and one overseas). The comparison highlights how, despite increased demand in certain regions, overseas sales still decreased, contrasting with the rise in domestic sales. This contrast emphasizes the different trends in domestic versus international markets.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||that for the fiscal year ending March 31 sales will climb to 600 billion yen from 566.54 billion yen||pretax profit was forecast at 35 billion yen , up from 28.53 billion yen in fiscal 1989||In the first part of the sentence, it is stated that sales for the fiscal year are expected to increase to 600 billion yen from 566.54 billion yen. In the second part of the sentence, the projection for pretax profit is mentioned, which is also expected to rise, from 28.53 billion yen to 35 billion yen. The expansion relationship is evident because both the sales and pretax profit projections show an increase. The expectation of higher sales leads to the anticipation of greater pretax profits, showing how the financial growth is expanded across both measures.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||pretax profit was forecast at 35 billion yen , up from 28.53 billion yen in fiscal 1989||Net is expected to rise to 17 billion yen from 12.82 billion yen a year earlier .||The first sentence states that the pretax profit was forecast to increase from 28.53 billion yen in fiscal 1989 to 35 billion yen. The second sentence also discusses an increase, but for net profit, from 12.82 billion yen to 17 billion yen. The relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion because both describe growth in different measures of profitability (pretax and net) over the same period. The second sentence expands on the financial improvement theme introduced in the first sentence by providing additional details about net profit growth.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||ECONOMIC GROWTH APPEARS to be leveling off||Factory orders and construction outlays were largely flat in September , .||The first sentence states that economic growth appears to be leveling off. The second sentence provides more specific details to support this claim by mentioning that factory orders and construction outlays were largely flat in September. Thus, the second sentence expands upon the idea presented in the first sentence by offering evidence (flat factory orders and construction outlays) that supports the notion of economic growth leveling off.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||The minimum-wage bill worked out by Congress and Bush won easy approval in the House .||The compromise plan , which boosts the minimum wage for the first time since 1981 , is expected to clear the Senate soon .||The first sentence states that the minimum-wage bill, which was a result of collaboration between Congress and Bush, received effortless approval in the House. The second sentence provides additional details about this bill, specifying that it represents a compromise and that it increases the minimum wage for the first time since 1981, further predicting its likely passage in the Senate. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the content of the first by giving more context and detail about the bill mentioned.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Steinberg sought clearance to buy more than 15 % of United Air 's parent , saying he may seek control .||they doubted the financier would make a bid by himself||In the first sentence, it is mentioned that Steinberg wanted permission to purchase over 15% of United Air's parent company and indicated the possibility of seeking control. The second sentence introduces doubt from others about whether Steinberg would actually make an offer on his own. These two sentences present a comparison between Steinberg's intentions (expressed in the first sentence) and the skepticism of others regarding those intentions (described in the second sentence). This comparison highlights the difference between what Steinberg is considering doing and the doubts others have about his potential actions.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||All this has cast a pall over Columbia Savings & Loan Association and its high-rolling 43-year-old chairman , Thomas Spiegel , .||Bears have targeted Columbia 's stock because of the thrift 's exposure to the shaky junk market .||The first sentence states that there is a negative situation affecting Columbia Savings & Loan Association and its chairman, Thomas Spiegel. The second sentence explains one reason for this situation: bears have targeted Columbia's stock due to the thrift's exposure to the shaky junk market. The second sentence expands on the first by providing additional information about why the negative situation exists, thus deepening our understanding of the context. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||And some investors fault Mr. Spiegel 's life style||he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in Columbia 's jet planes||The first sentence indicates that there is criticism from some investors regarding Mr. Spiegel's lifestyle.The second sentence provides details about this lifestyle: he earns a significant amount of money and uses Columbia's jet planes for travel. The second sentence explains the basis for the criticism mentioned in the first sentence, indicating that the investors' faultfinding is contingent upon Mr. Spiegel's high-earning and luxurious travel habits.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'since'] ||But in recent days , Columbia has edged up , closing at 5 1/4 , up 3/8 , yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure .||Columbia 's Southern California branches are highly salable , and the thrift has $ 458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets .||The first sentence indicates that there has been a recent increase in Columbia's stock price due to speculation about a potential restructuring. The second sentence provides information about the salability of Columbia's Southern California branches and the equity underlying its assets. This information could be a contributing factor or reason for the speculation mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the details about Columbia's financial position and assets are contingent upon the context provided by the speculation in the first sentence. The relationship is one of contingency because the second sentence offers additional context or justification for the speculation mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||But its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered .||These were Allied Stores , Western Union Telegraph , Gillett Holdings , SCI Television and Texas Air , .||The first sentence states that among the 17 big junk holdings, only a few bonds have been significantly affected.The second sentence lists specific examples of those bonds that have been "really battered".Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by providing specific details (the names of the companies) about which bonds have been significantly affected, hence the expansion relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||though many other bonds in Columbia 's portfolio also have lost value||Possibly offsetting that , Columbia recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ 70 million .||The first sentence indicates that several bonds in Columbia's portfolio have decreased in value. The second sentence discusses potential unrealized gains in publicly traded equity investments. The relationship between the two sentences is comparative because they present two contrasting financial situations within Columbia's investment portfolio: the loss in bond values and the potential gains in equity investments. The phrase "possibly offsetting that" suggests a comparison between the negative impact of the bonds' losses and the positive impact of the equity investments' gains.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Columbia 's thrift , which now is seeking a new chief operating officer , might be capitalized at , say $ 300 million , and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a California presence||The thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity||The first sentence outlines a scenario where Columbia's thrift is looking for a new COO and suggests its potential capitalization and sale strategy to a commercial bank interested in California. The second sentence posits that the thrift can be sold for more than its equity value. The contingency here lies in the suggestion that the sale (second sentence) hinges on the strategy described in the first sentence. In other words, the possibility of selling the thrift for more than its equity value is contingent upon the successful execution of the outlined strategy (finding a suitable buyer interested in expanding into California).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||But `` the concept is workable .||You sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank||The first sentence asserts that the concept is workable. The second sentence explains how this concept could work by detailing the process of selling a good bank and using the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank. This explanation expands on the assertion from the first sentence by providing specifics on the feasibility of the concept, hence establishing an expansion relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Mr. Spiegel 's next career move is a subject of speculation on Wall Street .||Few people think Mr. Spiegel wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift , which current rules would force Columbia to become .||The first sentence indicates that there is uncertainty around Mr. Spiegel's next career move. The second sentence presents a situation that few people believe will happen, specifically, Mr. Spiegel running a bread-and-butter thrift. This situation is contingent upon current rules forcing Columbia to transform into such a thrift. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, as the likelihood of Mr. Spiegel running a thrift is dependent on the current rules and his potential career choices.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||The second patent describes bone morphogenetic protein-1 , a substance that can induce formation of new cartilage .||The patent covers BMP-1 type proteins and pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating bone or cartilage defects||The first sentence introduces the concept of bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1) and its role in inducing the formation of new cartilage. The second sentence expands upon this by specifying what aspects of BMP-1 are covered under the patent, including types of proteins, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods for treating bone or cartilage defects. This additional information broadens the understanding of how BMP-1 is utilized and protected legally, hence forming an expansion of the initial concept.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as'] ||some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter||Mr. Thomas , currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court .||The first sentence indicates that there will be questioning from liberal members of the panel regarding the ABA rating. The second sentence introduces information about Mr. Thomas and his potential role in adding a conservative perspective to the court. The contingency relationship is evident because the context implies that the questioning by liberal members (a potential action) could be related to the balance of perspectives on the court, specifically in response to the addition of a conservative voice like Mr. Thomas. The potential questioning is contingent upon the implications of Mr. Thomas's appointment.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Groups have accused him of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies .||Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC have said they oppose Mr. Thomas 's nomination because of `` serious questions about his judgment and respect for the law . ''||The first sentence states that groups have accused Mr. Thomas of advocating policies that narrowed rights for older workers and ignoring discrimination by large companies. The second sentence expands on this by specifying who among those groups is taking action - in this case, fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC - and explains why they oppose his nomination: due to serious questions about his judgment and respect for the law. The second sentence adds more detail to the reasons behind the opposition mentioned in the first sentence, thus forming an expansion relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'rather'] ||the administration is n't worried about the ABA rating||We 're pleased the ABA rated him qualified||The first sentence states that the administration isn't worried about the ABA rating, suggesting they have a positive view of it. The second sentence expands on this by specifying what the administration is pleased about: the fact that the ABA rated the individual as "qualified." This further explains the reason for the lack of worry—the positive rating from the ABA. The expansion comes through providing more detail about the nature of the ABA rating and the administration's satisfaction with it.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants||Lentjes ' product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b . H. plant engineering unit||The first sentence states the reason for acquiring a stake in the specialized engineering company: to expand production of environmental supplies for power plants. The second sentence explains how this goal will be achieved: through the compatibility of Lentjes' products with those of Lurgi G.m.b.H. Therefore, the acquisition is contingent upon the compatibility of the product mixes, as this compatibility is what enables the expansion goal to be met.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock .||A plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices .||The first sentence states that a sale has replaced a planned initial public offering (IPO) for Lentjes stock. The second sentence provides context for this decision, suggesting that the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices disrupted plans to list the stock before the end of the year. Therefore, the contingency relationship is established because the action taken (replacing the IPO with a sale) is contingent upon the market conditions (weakness of share prices). The change in strategy is a direct response to the market situation, illustrating a causal link between the events.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||ITC officials said final Commerce Department and ITC rulings wo n't come until next March or later .||If both agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law , the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports , which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements .||The first sentence indicates that the final rulings from the Commerce Department and the ITC will occur at some point in the future, specifically next March or later. The second sentence describes what would happen if both agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law, which includes assessing penalty duties on the imports. The temporal relationship is established by the sequence of events: the rulings will occur at a future date, and if those rulings find violations, then the assessment of penalty duties will follow. The potential actions described in the second sentence are contingent upon the outcomes of the rulings mentioned in the first sentence and are set to occur after those rulings.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have , because few jobs will end up being eliminated .||`` It 's a cosmetic move , '' said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co .||The first sentence states that some analysts doubted the impact of the retirement package due to minimal job reductions. The second sentence quotes Jonathan S. Gelles describing the move as "cosmetic." This quote expands on the skepticism expressed in the first sentence, explaining why the analysts think the retirement package has limited impact—it is seen as a superficial effort rather than a substantial change. Thus, the second sentence provides additional detail that supports and expands upon the skepticism introduced in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation||The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors .||The first sentence indicates that the company has faced takeover attempts in the past. The second sentence explains a specific measure (adopting a shareholder-rights plan) taken by the company earlier in the year to protect itself from such attempts. This shows that the action (implementing the plan) was contingent upon the ongoing issue (takeover speculation). The relationship is one of contingency because the adoption of the plan was a direct response to the threat of takeovers.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy||Earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs||The first sentence states that there is an early retirement plan which is part of a cost-control strategy. The second sentence gives more detail about this strategy by mentioning earlier staff reduction moves that trimmed about 300 jobs. Thus, the second sentence expands on the cost-control strategy mentioned in the first sentence by providing specific actions taken under this strategy.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Right up front in the preface , co-author William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity .||When offered a free trip from the Bronx , Wedtech 's home , to Washington , D.C. , by one of Wedtech 's principals , he tells the reader , `` mindful of accepting anything of value from those I was writing about , I declined . ''||The first sentence states that co-author William Sternberg provides an example of his own integrity in the preface. The second sentence then details an instance where Sternberg demonstrated this integrity: he declined a free trip, showing his ethical stance on not accepting valuable things from subjects he was writing about. The second sentence expands on the claim made in the first by providing specific evidence of Sternberg's integrity, thus deepening our understanding of what was initially stated.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive , high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers .||Bribe by bribe , Mr. Sternberg and his co-author , Matthew C. Harrison Jr. , lead us along the path Wedtech traveled , from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor , entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy .||The first sentence indicates there is a need to understand why the author felt the need to include a specific note of assurance in the book. The second sentence provides context for this by detailing the content of the book, specifically focusing on the journey of a company called Wedtech. The contingency relationship is established because the explanation for the author's note of assurance (the reason it was included) is contingent upon understanding the subject matter of the book, which is detailed in the second sentence. Essentially, the necessity of the assurance becomes clear when one understands the nature of the story being told in the book.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Mr. Neuberger realized that , although of Italian ancestry , Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico .||The two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation .||The first sentence indicates that Mr. Neuberger came to a realization about Mr. Mariotta's eligibility as a minority based on his birthplace despite his Italian ancestry. The second sentence introduces an action that the two partners needed to undertake, which is to falsify the true ownership of the corporation. The action (falsifying ownership) appears to be dependent on the realization (Mr. Mariotta's qualification as a minority). This dependency suggests that the need to falsify ownership stems from the desire to leverage Mr. Mariotta's status as a minority, creating a contingent relationship between the two sentences.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||The two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation .||Instead of 50/50 it became , on paper only , two-thirds Mariotta , one-third Neuberger , and they were in the program and off to the races .||The first sentence states that the two partners needed to falsify the true ownership of the corporation.The second sentence describes the specific way in which they did this: by changing the ownership structure to two-thirds Mariotta, one-third Neuberger, and then proceeding with their plan. The action taken in the second sentence (falsifying the ownership structure) is contingent upon the need expressed in the first sentence (to falsify ownership). The change in ownership and proceeding with their plan are direct responses to the need for falsification, thus establishing a contingent relationship.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||Besides being a `` minority-owned company '' Wedtech was located in the South Bronx , a blighted area , made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign .||The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s .||The first sentence indicates that Wedtech, besides being minority-owned, was also located in the South Bronx, which was referenced by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 campaign.The second sentence explains how the company capitalized on this connection by aligning its image with Carter's rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and continuing to leverage its minority and South Bronx status during the Reagan era. This shows that the company's actions (plugging into Carter's rhetoric and continued use of the minority-South Bronx angle) were contingent upon its location and minority ownership status. The relationship is one of contingency because the company's strategy depended on these characteristics.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi now serving a jail sentence , the company began a career of bribing federal , state and local public officials and those close to public officials , .||Wedtech did n't just use old fashioned bribery .||The first sentence outlines the actions of a company, indicating that it started bribing public officials and those close to them, using Congressman Mario Biaggi's case as an example.The second sentence states that Wedtech used methods other than "old-fashioned bribery."The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the unspecified methods used by Wedtech with traditional bribery, suggesting that Wedtech employed different or more sophisticated tactics. This comparison highlights the nature or variety of corrupt practices employed by the company.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Alternative', 'instead'] ||Wedtech did n't just use old fashioned bribery .||It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling , retaining politically connected `` respectable '' law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger .||The first sentence states that Wedtech used methods other than traditional bribery. The second sentence details some of those methods, such as using politically connected "respectable" law firms, investment bankers, and political consultants, and specifically mentions the involvement of Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger. The second sentence expands on the first by providing specific examples of the modern techniques of influence peddling mentioned in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'furthermore'] ||It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling , retaining politically connected `` respectable '' law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger .||When necessary , it sought and received assistance from organized crime .||The first sentence outlines the various modern techniques used by an unspecified entity to exert influence, mentioning the hiring of politically connected "respectable" law firms, investment bankers, and political consultants, as well as the involvement of Lyn Nofzinger, a confidant of Reagan. The second sentence adds to this list of methods by stating that when needed, the entity also sought and received help from organized crime. This sentence expands on the range of strategies employed by including another method of exerting influence, thus providing additional detail about the means used.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'since'] ||Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company .||Wedtech management used the merit system .||The first sentence indicates a scenario where individuals who received bribes could become partners in the company. The second sentence introduces Wedtech management's use of a merit system. The contingent relationship can be explained as follows: If Wedtech management uses a merit system, it implies a structured process for advancement or roles within the company. Given the context of the first sentence, this suggests that under the merit system, there may be instances where those who were bribed could become partners based on the system's criteria or as a result of the bribes being considered a form of 'merit' in this context. The use of the merit system by Wedtech management is contingent upon the scenario described in the first sentence, where bribes potentially lead to partnership.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||Wedtech management used the merit system .||If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag , but equity .||The first sentence indicates that Wedtech management used the merit system for some form of evaluation or reward.The second sentence reveals specifics of how this merit system was applied, suggesting that those who assisted in corrupt schemes were rewarded with cash and equity. Thus, the second sentence explains a particular application of the merit system mentioned in the first sentence, showing that the rewards under the merit system were contingent upon participation in corrupt activities.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag , but equity .||If you were not an effective crook , you found yourself out in the cold , .||The first sentence describes the reward for being particularly helpful in a corrupt scheme, which includes receiving not only cash but also equity. The second sentence contrasts this by describing the consequence for those who were not effective in such schemes: they were excluded or 'out in the cold.' These two sentences establish a comparison by contrasting the outcomes for individuals based on their effectiveness in participating in corrupt activities.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy , easy-to-read tabloid writing style , `` Feeding Frenzy '' often falls short of gripping reading .||None of the scams show much ingenuity : Auditors found crookery the first day on the job .||The first sentence states that "Feeding Frenzy" fails to be gripping reading despite its sensational content and breezy style. The second sentence provides a reason for this by describing the nature of the scams covered in the book, suggesting they lack ingenuity as auditors discovered the fraud quickly. This second sentence explains why the book may not be as engaging as expected, supporting the claim that "Feeding Frenzy" falls short of being gripping. Thus, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, offering a specific reason for the book's failure to captivate readers.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as'] ||None of the scams show much ingenuity||Auditors found crookery the first day on the job||The first sentence states that the scams lacked ingenuity. The second sentence tells us that auditors discovered fraudulent activities immediately upon starting their work. The reason the relationship is one of contingency is that the lack of ingenuity in the scams (first sentence) likely made it easier for auditors to uncover them on the first day (second sentence). Thus, the ease with which the auditors found the "crookery" is contingent upon the low level of ingenuity in the scams.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||Auditors found crookery the first day on the job||Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up .||The first sentence states that the auditors discovered fraudulent activities on their first day. The second sentence explains how Wedtech's scammers responded to this discovery by bribing the auditors. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the scammers' action (bribing the auditors) being contingent upon the auditors' discovery of fraud. The bribe was a direct response to the auditors finding the crookery, showing a dependency between the two events.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'but'] ||The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz , a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack .||He enters the story toward the end , just in time to get arrested .||The first sentence introduces Irving Louis Lobsenz (Rusty Kent London) and provides details about his life, suggesting he is an interesting character within the narrative. The second sentence discusses his involvement in the story, specifically mentioning his arrest near the end. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the character's background (an interesting figure due to his unique life story) with his role in the story (a late entry that leads to arrest). This contrast highlights the nature of his character and his contribution to the plot.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'although'] ||Absorbed in doling out `` Feeding Frenzy 's '' tidbits , the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech , .||They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end `` rigid affirmative action programs . ''||The first sentence states that the authors are very focused on sharing details about "Feeding Frenzy" and neglect the underlying issues of Wedtech. The second sentence indicates that they eventually suggest the courts consider ending strict affirmative action programs. The comparison relationship can be explained as follows: Both sentences discuss the authors' treatment of certain topics, with the first sentence highlighting what they overlook and the second showing a point they eventually make. The comparison lies in contrasting what the authors focus on versus what they address later, both in terms of content (Wedtech vs. affirmative action) and their level of attention (glossing over vs. coming around).
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end `` rigid affirmative action programs . ''||Programs like Section 8 A are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up .||The first sentence indicates that there's a suggestion for the courts to consider ending rigid affirmative action programs. The second sentence uses a metaphor to criticize programs like Section 8A, suggesting they're problematic due to their nature of being too enticing (like leaving gold in the street) and thus attracting abuse (thieves scooping it up). The relationship is contingent because the criticism in the second sentence provides a reason for why such actions (reconsidering rigid programs) might be suggested or deemed necessary in the first place. The suggestion to reconsider the programs is contingent upon the perceived flaws and potential for abuse highlighted in the second sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Programs like Section 8 A are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up .||Numerous other scandals , among them the ones at HUD , have the same characteristics as Wedtech .||The first sentence uses a metaphor to criticize programs like Section 8A, suggesting they are set up in a way that almost invites corruption or misuse. The second sentence expands on this idea by providing examples of other instances where similar issues have arisen, specifically mentioning scandals at HUD and comparing them to the Wedtech scandal. By mentioning "numerous other scandals" with the "same characteristics," the text broadens the scope from the specific criticism of Section 8A to include other instances of similar problems, thus expanding the point made in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Why are programs like this not eliminated ?||`` Feeding Frenzy '' does provide a few clues .||The first sentence questions the existence of certain programs, suggesting there may be reasons for their continuation despite potential issues or inefficiencies. The second sentence introduces "Feeding Frenzy" as a specific program and implies that it offers some explanations or insights into why such programs persist. The expansion relationship is established because the second sentence provides additional information that helps to answer the question posed in the first sentence, specifically by suggesting that "Feeding Frenzy" can offer clues as to why programs like it continue to exist.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||`` Feeding Frenzy '' does provide a few clues .||In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party .||The first sentence indicates that "Feeding Frenzy" offers some clues about a topic.The second sentence provides more specific details about what those clues pertain to: the existence and nature of groups within various levels of U.S. government that can be characterized as a political insider commercial party. The second sentence expands upon the first by specifying what kind of clues are provided and what they reveal. Thus, the relationship is one of expansion, where additional information is given to clarify or elaborate on the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth , regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment , there is big money to be made in influencing , brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government .||They are our version of the East bloc 's Nomenklatura||The first sentence explains how certain individuals benefit financially from government activities involving wealth redistribution, commerce regulation, and defense spending. The second sentence identifies these individuals as "our version of the East bloc's Nomenklatura," referring to them using a term that historically denotes a privileged class in Soviet society. The second sentence expands on the description of who these individuals are, providing more context and clarification about their status and role. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence provides additional information about the group mentioned in the first sentence.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change .||How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders ?||The first sentence indicates a strong resistance to change from "they".The second sentence questions the existence of government programs and policies that benefit political insiders. This suggests a possible reason for the resistance to change: if changing the current system would disrupt the benefits received by insiders, then those benefiting would resist change. Therefore, the existence of such programs and policies may explain the lack of desire to see anything change, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders ?||This is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal .||The first sentence questions the existence of government programs and policies that may benefit political insiders. The second sentence identifies "the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal" which directly links back to the issue raised in the first sentence. In other words, the Wedtech scandal is presented as an example or instance that expands upon the broader issue of political insiders benefiting from government programs and policies. Thus, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by providing a specific context (the Wedtech scandal) that illustrates the problem being discussed.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||`` The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business .||Everything will be taken over by the new company||The first sentence states that the bankruptcy court will no longer be involved in the shipbuilding business. The second sentence expands on this by explaining what will happen next: everything will be taken over by a new company. The second sentence provides additional details about the transition mentioned in the first sentence, specifically who will take over the operations, thus expanding on the initial statement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Under an accord signed yesterday , the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company , each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa $ .||Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa , most of it as subordinated debt , and take a minority stake in the new company .||The first sentence outlines an agreement where the government and Union Bank of Finland will become major shareholders in a new company by investing 100 million Finnish markkaa each. The second sentence details another part of the same context, specifying that Oy Waertsilae will also contribute capital (200 million markkaa, mostly as subordinated debt) and gain a minority stake in the new company. The second sentence expands on the information presented in the first by adding more detail about the financial contributions and stakes in the new company.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The St. Louis company earned $ 45.2 million , or 65 cents a share , compared with $ 84.9 million , or $ 1.24 a share , a year earlier .||Sales in the latest period were $ 1.76 billion , a 13 % increase from last year 's $ 1.55 billion .||The first sentence provides information about the earnings per share and total earnings of the St. Louis company for two different periods (current and a year earlier).The second sentence expands on the financial details by providing information about the sales in the current period and comparing them to the previous year. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence adds more context to the financial situation of the company by detailing its sales performance, which complements the earnings data provided in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||For the year ended Sept. 30 , Ralston earned $ 422.5 million , or $ 6.44 a share , up 8.9 % from $ 387.8 million , or $ 5.63 a share .||This year 's results included a gain of $ 70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations .||The first sentence provides information about Ralston's earnings for the year ended Sept. 30. It indicates an 8.9% increase in earnings compared to the previous year. The second sentence offers additional detail about the current year's results, specifically mentioning a gain of $70.2 million from the disposal of seafood operations. This detail explains part of the reason for the increased earnings mentioned in the first sentence, providing an expansion of the financial results.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville , N.C. , the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company||The battery plant , , will be closed over the next year or so||In the first sentence, it is mentioned that part of the company's restructuring includes phasing out a battery facility in Greenville, North Carolina. The second sentence provides more detail about the same battery plant, specifying that it will be closed over the next year or so. The second sentence expands on the information provided in the first sentence by giving a timeline for the closure of the battery plant.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures , .||For the year , pet food volume was flat , the company said .||The first sentence indicates that Ralston experienced a fourth-quarter slump, attributing part of the reason to higher ingredient costs in the pet food business and competitive pressures. The second sentence provides additional context for the pet food business by stating that the annual volume was flat. The contingency relationship is evident because the detail about the yearly flat volume in the pet food business follows and provides further explanation or context for the mentioned slump. Thus, the information in the second sentence is contingent upon the situation described in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases , .||The Continental Baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales||The first sentence states that the cereal division achieved higher operating profit due to increased sales volume. The second sentence provides more detail about how the Continental Baking business also experienced benefits: higher margins on bread and increased cake sales. This additional information expands upon the initial statement about increased profits and volume, offering specific examples within the baking business. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||River barge rates have soared 40 % this fall from a year earlier .||Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business .||The first sentence states that river barge rates have significantly increased by 40% compared to the previous year. The second sentence mentions that railroad companies and some ports are experiencing a sudden increase in business. The expansion relationship is demonstrated because the rise in barge rates likely led to more people and businesses turning to alternative transportation methods, such as railroads and ports, causing an expansion or increase in their business.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||The Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn in October , .||The Soviet Union wants much of it delivered by January , .||The first sentence states that the Soviet Union purchased a specific amount of U.S. corn in October. The second sentence adds information about the timeline for delivery, specifying when the Soviet Union wants the corn delivered. The second sentence expands upon the initial statement by providing additional details about the purchase, specifically the desired delivery date. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record||`` It is going to be real tight . ''||The first sentence indicates that a large amount of corn is being shipped to a single customer within a short timeframe, suggesting a potentially challenging logistical situation.The second sentence expresses that the situation will be "real tight," indicating the speaker's awareness of the difficulties that may arise from the shipping endeavor. The contingency relationship is established because the second sentence reflects a direct consequence or result of the situation described in the first sentence: the tightness of the operation is contingent upon the scale and timeline of the corn shipment.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||But the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month .||At St. Louis , the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed||The first sentence indicates that the Army Corps of Engineers anticipates the river level to keep falling.The second sentence provides a specific instance of this prediction: the water level at St. Louis is expected to drop further when the flow of the Missouri River slows down. This detail is contingent upon the expectation mentioned in the first sentence. The contingency relationship is established because the drop in water level at St. Louis (second sentence) is dependent on the condition of the river level continuing to fall (first sentence).
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||At St. Louis , the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed||Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years .||The first sentence states that the water level of the Mississippi River at St. Louis is currently 6.5 feet below normal and may drop another 2.5 feet when the Missouri River's flow is reduced. The second sentence provides context for the significance of similar low water levels by mentioning that they caused problems for barge shipments the previous year during a severe drought. Thus, the second sentence expands on the potential impact of the low water levels described in the first sentence, giving historical context and explaining the consequences of such conditions.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices .||Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise .||The first sentence states that farmers are well-positioned to increase corn prices.The second sentence explains why this is the case: due to the drought reducing U.S. stockpiles, farmers have ample storage space, allowing them to hold onto their crops until prices rise. Thus, the farmers' ability to wait for higher prices (second sentence) is contingent upon the circumstances described in the first sentence, specifically their favorable position following the drought and its effects on stockpiles.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'but'] ||In parts of Iowa , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 a bushel for corn .||Many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel||The first sentence provides information about the price offered by some grain elevators in parts of Iowa for corn ($2.15 per bushel).The second sentence suggests a likely farmer expectation, where many wouldn't sell until prices rose by at least 20 cents per bushel. This establishes a comparison between the current price offer and the expected minimum price increase desired by many farmers. The relationship is comparative as it contrasts the existing offer with the farmers' anticipated selling conditions.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||It is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game .||Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought , the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins .||The first sentence indicates uncertainty about the outcome of a waiting game, suggesting a situation where the results are unpredictable or dependent on further information. The second sentence provides details about the state of U.S. corn stockpiles after a drought and the projection for storage before the next harvest. The contingency relationship is established because the specifics about corn stockpiles and projections could potentially influence the outcome of the waiting game mentioned in the first sentence. In other words, the results of the waiting game may depend on factors like the amount of corn in storage and how those stockpiles are managed.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation .||`` The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped , '' said Bill Biedermann , Allendale Inc. research director .||The first sentence indicates that some analysts are concerned about the potential actions of investors in response to reports about the grain industry's issues. Specifically, they fear that investors may buy corn futures contracts without significant returns.The second sentence expands on these concerns by providing a specific viewpoint from Bill Biedermann, the research director at Allendale Inc., who explains that the public is purchasing into the market despite there being ample grain available for shipment. This statement supports and expands upon the initial concern by offering more detail about the situation and why the analysts might be worried.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||And it is n't clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace .||The Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October because of delays .||The first sentence indicates uncertainty about whether the Soviet Union will continue purchasing at the same rate. The second sentence provides context for the pattern of purchases, explaining that orders were concentrated in October due to delays. This suggests that the unusual purchasing pattern (concentration in October) may be a factor contributing to the uncertainty about future purchases. Therefore, the contingency relationship is established because the reason provided (orders being compressed into October) may explain the uncertainty expressed in the first sentence.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October because of delays .||The Soviet Union usually begins buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall .||The first sentence explains that the Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October due to delays.The second sentence states that typically, the Soviet Union starts purchasing U.S. crops earlier in the fall.The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the usual practice (buying earlier in the fall) with the current situation (orders compressed into October due to delays). This contrast highlights a deviation from the norm, indicating that something unusual has occurred in the timing of the purchases.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||but much of the action was in heating oil||Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire , .||The first sentence states that much of the action was in heating oil, suggesting significant activity or changes in this market. The second sentence provides more specific information about what caused prices to rise in the context of heating oil: a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire. This additional detail expands on the initial statement by explaining one reason for the increased activity and price movement in the heating oil market. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence provides further details to support the claim made in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire , .||Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon , up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange .||The first sentence states that prices rose due to news of a significant West German refinery being damaged in a fire. The second sentence provides more specific details about the price increase, mentioning that heating oil for November delivery ended at a particular price, up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange. This second sentence expands on the initial statement by giving concrete examples of how the prices were affected.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon , up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange .||West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $ 19.94 a barrel .||The first sentence states that heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon, up one cent. The second sentence describes the price movement of West Texas Intermediate for December delivery, which advanced 22 cents to $19.94 a barrel. Both sentences discuss the price changes of different commodities (heating oil and crude oil) on the same exchange (New York Mercantile Exchange). The comparison relationship is evident as both events involve similar actions (price changes) occurring in the same context (commodities trading). The price movements of these commodities can be compared to understand market trends or reactions.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $ 19.94 a barrel .||Gasoline futures continued a sell-off that began Monday .||In the first sentence, the price movement of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for December delivery is described, indicating an increase of 22 cents to reach $19.94 a barrel. In contrast, the second sentence mentions that gasoline futures are experiencing a sell-off, suggesting a decline in prices. These sentences present a comparison by highlighting different movements in related markets: an increase in WTI prices versus a decrease (sell-off) in gasoline futures. This contrast in market behavior between oil and gasoline futures illustrates the comparative relationship.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'instance'] ||Futures prices eased||December delivery gold fell $ 3.20 an ounce to $ 377.60 .||The first sentence states that futures prices eased, indicating a general decline in futures markets. The second sentence provides specific details about the decline in one particular futures contract: December delivery gold fell by $3.20 an ounce to $377.60. This detail supports and expands upon the initial statement of easing futures prices, giving concrete evidence of the trend mentioned. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by offering a specific example of the easing mentioned.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||December delivery gold fell $ 3.20 an ounce to $ 377.60 .||December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $ 5.2180 .||Both sentences describe changes in the prices of precious metals (gold and silver). The first sentence reports the decrease in the price of December delivery gold. The second sentence details the decline in the price of December silver. These sentences expand upon each other by providing additional information about market movements for different commodities within the same context (precious metal futures). Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, as they both contribute to a broader understanding of the market conditions for precious metals.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||December delivery gold fell $ 3.20 an ounce to $ 377.60 . December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $ 5.2180 .||January platinum was down $ 5.70 an ounce at $ 494.50 .||The first sentence states that the price of December delivery gold and December silver both fell. The second sentence details the decline in the price of January platinum. These sentences share a common theme of precious metals' prices falling. The second sentence expands on the topic by providing additional information about the decline in another metal's price (platinum), thus broadening the context of falling metal prices beyond just gold and silver.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||Precious metals , gold in particular , currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability , according to William O'Neill , .||The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities||The first sentence states that precious metals, especially gold, are currently more influenced by stock market fluctuations than by the dollar, as traders seek more stable investments.According to the second sentence, the recent rise in precious metals was due to uncertainty and volatility in the stock market. This sentence expands on the idea presented in the first sentence by providing an example of how stock market volatility has affected precious metals. It explains the specific outcome (rally in precious metals) that results from the influence of stock market fluctuations mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the relationship between these two sentences is expansion.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities||Yesterday , the stock market rose strongly , creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders||The first sentence explains that the rally in precious metals happened due to uncertainty and volatility in the stock market. The second sentence describes a different situation where the stock market performed well, leading to a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders. These two situations are being compared to illustrate how changes in the stock market can lead to contrasting behaviors in precious metals trading. The comparison highlights the impact of stock market performance on the attitudes of precious metals traders.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Yesterday , the stock market rose strongly , creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders||Silver and platinum , which have more of an industrial nature than gold , were even weaker||The first sentence states that the stock market rose strongly, leading to a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders. The second sentence expands on this idea by providing specific examples of how this defensive attitude affected different types of precious metals: silver and platinum were even weaker due to their industrial nature. This detail explains the broader impact of the defensive attitude mentioned in the first sentence, thus expanding on the initial point.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||Silver is also under pressure of `` extremely high '' inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange||Yesterday , these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces , according to an exchange spokesman .||The first sentence states that silver is under pressure due to extremely high inventories in Commodity Exchange warehouses. The second sentence provides more detail about these inventories, specifically mentioning a rise of 170,262 ounces to a record level of 226,570,380 ounces, as reported by an exchange spokesman.

The second sentence then provides a specific example of this phenomenon by explaining how the positive sentiment in copper stocks influences the demand for copper futures contracts, due to expectations of increased metal demand in a stronger economy. Thus, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first one by giving a concrete instance of the 'sympathetic reaction' in the context of copper.

The second sentence provides details about the report, specifically that the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's October index rose to 51.6% after three previous months of readings below 50%. The contingency relationship is established because the content of the report (the rise in the index) is contingent upon the report itself; the firmness in copper is influenced by the positive report, showing a cause-and-effect relationship.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago 's October index rose to 51.6 % after three previous months of readings below 50 % .||The September index was 47.1 % .||The first sentence states that the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's October index rose to 51.6%, following three prior months with readings below 50%.

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the Marathon Oil Co. unit to $ 198 million from $ 180 million .||The Texas Oil & Gas division continues to operate in the red , although losses narrowed to $ 9 million from $ 15 million .||The first sentence discusses the positive financial outcome for the Marathon Oil Co. unit due to higher crude oil prices, specifically an increase in operating profit. The second sentence provides additional information about another part of the business, the Texas Oil & Gas division, which is operating at a loss, albeit a reduced one. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence broadens the context by adding more detail about the company's financial status beyond the initial positive news, including the fact that not all divisions are performing positively.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||The Texas Oil & Gas division continues to operate in the red , .||USX announced in October that it was soliciting bids to sell TXO 's oil and gas reserves .||The first sentence indicates that the Texas Oil & Gas division is experiencing financial difficulties by operating at a loss.The second sentence tells us that USX announced plans to sell TXO's oil and gas reserves. It can be inferred that the decision to sell the reserves is contingent upon the financial situation of the division. The company's financial struggles likely influenced USX's decision to seek bids for selling its assets, thus creating a contingent relationship between the two sentences.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||that investor Carl Icahn had increased his stake in USX to 13.1 % and threatened a takeover or other business combination||Mr. Icahn has said he believes USX would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments .||The first sentence states that Carl Icahn increased his stake in USX and threatened a takeover or other business combination.

This additional detail explains one of the reasons behind Mr. Icahn's actions mentioned in the first sentence, expanding on his intentions and motivations for the potential takeover or business combination. Therefore, the second sentence expands the description of the situation introduced in the first sentence.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Profit for the nine months jumped 21 % to $ 721 million , or $ 2.62 a share , from $ 598 million , or $ 2.07 a share .||Sales rose 10 % to $ 13.8 billion from $ 12.5 billion .||The first sentence provides information about the increase in profit for the nine-month period, both in total dollars and per share. The second sentence details the rise in sales, which helps to explain the cause behind the profit increase. The relationship is one of expansion, as the growth in sales directly contributes to the increased profit. The rise in sales over the specified period led to a higher profit, demonstrating a positive correlation and expansion between the two financial metrics.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||he would like to be able to use this procedure||that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case||In the first sentence, "he" expresses a desire to use a certain procedure. In the second sentence, it is mentioned that the President is considering a declaration that could lead to a test case. The contingency here lies in the fact that the President's action (considering the declaration) is likely to be a response to or in consideration of "his" wish to use the procedure. The President's potential action is contingent upon the desire expressed by "he" for using the specific procedure.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||that these events took place 35 years ago||It has no bearing on our work force today .||The first sentence states that certain events happened 35 years ago.

The second sentence mentions that no price has been set for the new shares. The comparison relationship is evident because the second sentence contrasts the specifics of the share distribution with the lack of pricing information, highlighting what is known (the exchange ratio) versus what remains unknown (the price).
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||To further load the stakes , Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist , with a young woman .||This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it .||The first sentence introduces an element (a romance storyline) that Mr. Lane added to increase the stakes in a narrative. The second sentence suggests that the storyline might have a greater impact if Mr. Lane were equally compelling on screen as he is behind the scenes. The comparison here is between Mr. Lane's abilities off-screen (where he is described positively) and on-screen (where there is a suggestion of potential improvement). The relationship is comparative because it evaluates the relative strengths of Mr. Lane's contributions in different contexts.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||Who 's telling the truth ?||Everybody -- and nobody .||The first sentence poses a question about who is telling the truth. The second sentence provides an answer by saying "Everybody -- and nobody," suggesting that there is a complex situation where truth may be relative or differently perceived.

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander||Pressures began to build .||The first sentence indicates that "she" (referring to someone, possibly a colleague or friend of the subject) defended the subject against colleagues who criticized her as a grandstander. The second sentence introduces a new situation where pressures started to increase. The Expansion relationship is demonstrated by the fact that the second sentence builds upon the context established in the first sentence. It implies that the defense provided by "she" may have occurred within a context where increasing pressures were affecting the environment or the individuals involved, thus expanding the narrative with additional context.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||that `` failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated||In some cases , the IRS asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985 .||The first sentence states the consequence of not submitting requested information voluntarily, which is summons enforcement action.The second sentence provides specific context for the request, mentioning that the IRS asked for information dating back to forms received in 1985.

The relationship is one of expansion, as the second sentence adds detail to the context of the first sentence, specifically providing the financial basis for the judge's humorous remark. The salary figure helps explain why the judge might feel he could be out-earned by his clerks in a few years.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||`` At the prices we were charged , there should have been some return for the dollar .||There was n't . ''||The first sentence sets up an expectation: given the prices they were charged, one would reasonably expect some value or benefit in return.The second sentence directly contrasts with this expectation by stating that there wasn't any return for the money spent. This contrast emphasizes the lack of value received compared to the high cost, thus establishing a comparison between the expected value and the actual experience.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'although'] ||I do n't know and I do n't care||I 'm not saying advertising revenue is n't important||The first sentence expresses indifference ("I don't know and I don't care") toward a topic.The second sentence clarifies the speaker's stance on a related but distinct issue (the importance of advertising revenue).The comparison relationship is established through the contrast between the speaker's indifference in the first sentence and their more nuanced position in the second sentence. The speaker is differentiating between not caring about something unspecified and acknowledging the significance of advertising revenue, thus comparing their attitudes towards two potentially related topics.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'and'] ||What will happen to dividend growth next year ?||a single-digit rate of growth , reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits .||The first sentence poses a question about what will happen to dividend growth next year.

The second sentence explains what happened when it was discovered that the Berliner patent caveat predated Edison's patent application: Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed not to enter the telephone business. The comparison relationship is evident in the contrast between Western Union's initial aggressive legal stance and its subsequent retreat from the telephone market once the chronological precedence of the Berliner patent was established.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Several times , Chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of U.S. diplomats and clicked the trigger .||The rifles were n't loaded .||The first sentence describes an action taken by Chinese guards who pointed unloaded rifles at children. The second sentence provides information about the state of those rifles (not being loaded). The comparison relationship here is implied: the severity or potential threat of the action (pointing rifles at children) is being compared with the actual danger present (rifles were not loaded). Thus, the sentences are in a comparison relationship, as they contrast the appearance of a threatening situation with the reality that the rifles were not loaded.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||The statistics imply that three-quarters of blacks approve of Mr. Bush 's job performance and 85 % of blacks approve of Mrs. Bush .||If the assumption is that it is surprising that so few blacks find Mr. and Mrs. Bush distasteful , the positive view is even more newsworthy .||The first sentence presents statistical data suggesting high approval ratings for Mr. and Mrs. Bush among black Americans.The second sentence discusses the surprising nature of these approval ratings and how they make the positive view more noteworthy.

['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||Japan 's Finance Ministry had set up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time .||Maybe it was n't enough||The first sentence outlines specific actions taken by Japan's Finance Ministry to control market volatility through mechanisms for limiting futures price drops and suspending trading when necessary. The second sentence questions the adequacy of these measures. A comparison is drawn between the extent of the measures taken (as described in the first sentence) and the perceived need for more comprehensive solutions (implied in the second sentence). The relationship is one of comparison, evaluating whether the measures implemented were sufficient.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||the company had n't yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine||`` Once we do , they will receive very serious evaluation , ''||The first sentence states that the company has not received any documents from OSHA regarding a penalty or fine. The second sentence contains a quote where someone promises that once the documents are received, they will receive very serious evaluation. However, there is no direct comparison being made between the two sentences. Instead, the second sentence is a conditional statement that explains what will happen when the condition (receiving documents) in the first sentence is met. Therefore, the relationship provided (Comparison) does not fit the context. The correct relationship seems to be Contingency, indicating that one event depends on the other.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'indeed'] ||How does a nice new tax , say 5 % , on any financial transaction sound ?||That ought to make sure we 're all thinking for the long term .||The first sentence proposes the idea of a new 5% tax on financial transactions.

['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||Thousands of East Germans fled to Czechoslovakia after the East Berlin government lifted travel restrictions .||The ban on cross-border movement was imposed last month after a massive exodus of emigres to West Germany .||The first sentence describes an event where many East Germans fled to Czechoslovakia following the lifting of travel restrictions by the East Berlin government. The second sentence details the imposition of a ban on cross-border movement due to a large number of emigres going to West Germany. The comparison relationship is evident in the contrasting actions taken by the East Berlin government: first lifting travel restrictions, leading to an exodus, and then imposing a ban to prevent further departures. Both situations involve changes in policy regarding cross-border movement and their effects on the population.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'although'] ||Absorbed in doling out `` Feeding Frenzy 's '' tidbits , the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech , .||They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end `` rigid affirmative action programs . ''||The first sentence states that the authors are very focused on sharing details about "Feeding Frenzy" and neglect the underlying issues of Wedtech. The second sentence indicates that they eventually suggest the courts consider ending strict affirmative action programs. The comparison relationship can be explained as follows: Both sentences discuss the authors' treatment of certain topics, with the first sentence highlighting what they overlook and the second showing a point they eventually make. The comparison lies in contrasting what the authors focus on versus what they address later, both in terms of content (Wedtech vs. affirmative action) and their level of attention (glossing over vs. coming around).
