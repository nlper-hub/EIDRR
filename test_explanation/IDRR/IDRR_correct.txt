In other words, the potential benefit of holding the stock is dependent on the condition that Honeywell intends to hold the stock long term.
 For the nine months , Honeywell reported earnings of $ 212.1 million , or $ 4.92 a share , compared with earnings of $ 47.9 million , or $ 1.13 a share , a year earlier . ||| Sales declined slightly to $ 5.17 billion .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence provides information about Honeywell's earnings for the nine months, comparing the current period to the previous year. The second sentence discusses the decline in sales over the same period. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence adds more detail about the company's financial situation during the same period, specifically focusing on the decline in sales. This additional information helps to provide a fuller picture of Honeywell's financial performance during the period in question.
 Once again , your editorial page misstates the law to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions . ||| In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups , Michael S. Greve informs your readers , `` ... the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do ; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge '' `` Congress's Environmental Buccaneers , '' Sept. 18 . This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive , but it is simply wrong .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the editorial page misinterprets the law to conform to one's almost imperialistic skepticisms. The second sentence provides a specific example of this misinterpretation: Michael S. Greenvey explains the Clean Water Act, which outlines a specific claim about zero risk. This detailed account expands on the general misinterpretation mentioned in the first sentence, illustrating how the law is misinterpreted by the editorial page. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving a concrete instance of the misinterpretation.
 but it is simply wrong . ||| The Clean Water Act contains no `` legal standard '' of zero discharge .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence asserts that something is incorrect. The second sentence provides context for why this might be the case: the Clean Water Act does not provide a "legal standard" for zero discharge. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the lack of a "legal standard" (second sentence) could be a reason for the assertion that something is incorrect (first sentence). The existence of the "legal standard" is contingent upon the assertion that something is incorrect.
 The Clean Water Act contains no `` legal standard '' of zero discharge . ||| It requires that `` discharges of pollutants '' into the `` waters of the United States '' be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301 .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the Clean Water Act does not establish a "legal standard" for zero discharge. The second sentence explains what this means by specifying that "discharges of pollutants" must be authorized through permits that reflect the efflux limitations established by section 301. The second sentence expands on the first by providing more detail about the criteria under which the Clean Water Act is governed, thus deepening our understanding of the concept introduced in the first sentence.
 , the magazine just has n't kept up with the times . ||| , it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the magazine hasn't kept up with the times, suggesting a lack of innovation or growth. The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining one reason for this lack of innovation: the magazine has a reputation for being a magazine for boys who like to find sex-themed women. This further illustrates the lack of innovation mentioned in the first sentence, providing additional detail or elaboration on why the magazine hasn't kept up with the times.
 `` What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance . ||| People did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace , and in many ways we were n't . ''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates the intention to take a more aggressive stance.The second sentence explains a reason for this intention: people did not believe they were in tune with the marketplace, and in many cases, they weren't in tune with it. The desire to take a more aggressive stance is contingent upon the perception of not being in tune with the marketplace. The relationship is one of contingency because the action (taking a more aggressive stance) is a direct response to the perceived lack of integration.
 The 101-year-old magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before . ||| It largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics : .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that the magazine has never had to attract advertisers with significant enthusiasm before. The second sentence explains that this lack of enthusiasm was a result of its hard-to-favorable demographic. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the magazine's ability to attract advertisers (first sentence) is contingent upon its hard-to-favorable demographic (second sentence). The success of the magazine is a direct result of its inability to attract advertisers, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
 Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices -- $ , . ||| When ad dollars are tight , the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers , .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that one of the biggest factors is the high ad prices. The second sentence explains a reason for this high ad prices: when there is tight advertising budgets, the high page cost is a major barrier for advertisers. Thus, the second sentence provides a reason for the high ad prices mentioned in the first sentence, establishing a contingent relationship. The reason provided in the second sentence (high page cost) is contingent upon the situation described in the first sentence (high ad prices).
 But Ms. McCraw says the magazine is fighting back . ||| It now offers 30 regional editions , it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles , and it has been beefing up its sales force .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Ms. McCaw believes the magazine is fighting back. The second sentence provides specific actions taken by the magazine, such as offering 30 regional editions, launching ads adjacent to articles, and beefing up its sales force. These actions are examples of the aggressive tactics mentioned in the first sentence, thus expanding on the initial statement.
 The campaign , , takes advantage of the eye-catching photography that National Geographic is known for . ||| In one ad , a photo of the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris is paired with the headline , `` The only book more respected than ours does n't accept advertising . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the campaign uses the eye-catching photography that National Geographic is known for. The second sentence provides a specific example of this use of photography through an advertisement for a magazine called "Santa Fe Champale." This example expands on the initial claim by illustrating how the photography is used in a commercial, illustrating the point made in the first sentence. Thus, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by offering a concrete instance of the creative use of photography.
 In one ad , a photo of the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris is paired with the headline , `` The only book more respected than ours does n't accept advertising . '' ||| Another ad pictures a tree ant , magnified 80 times , with the headline , `` For impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence presents an advertisement featuring a photo of the Sassault in Paris and a caption stating that "The only book more respected doesn't accept advertising." The second sentence further elaborates on the content of the ad by describing another ad featuring a tree ad with a caption that emphasizes the reader's size beyond the initial reach. Both sentences present different aspects of the same ad, expanding on the theme of ad content and the theme of ad placements.
 Her goal : to top 300 ad pages in 1990 , up from about 274 this year . ||| Whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines the goal of topping 300 ad pages in 1990, up from about 143 this year. The second sentence discusses the uncertainty of whether she can meet this goal. The comparison relationship is evident as the second sentence contrasts the certainty of her goal with the uncertainty of its completion. It highlights the uncertainty surrounding her ability to meet the goal, highlighting the uncertainty around her progress.
 The ad campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of National Geographic ||| `` We want it to be a '90s kind of image . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the ad campaign is intended to complement the idea of National Geographic's image. The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying what the goal is: to create a '90s type of image.' This detail clarifies the nature of the ad campaign's purpose, providing more information about its intended impact on the image. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more context about the intended outcome of the ad campaign.
 Stephen Novick , 49 , was named executive vice president , deputy creative director at Grey Advertising , New York ||| He was executive vice president , director of broadcast production .|||Temporal|||Temporal|||The first sentence states that Stephen Novak was named executive vice president, creative director, at Grey Advertising in New York. The second sentence provides information about his previous position at the agency, where he was also executive vice president of broadcast production. The temporal relationship is evident because the second sentence describes an event (his previous role at Grey Advertising) that occurred after the first event (he was named executive vice president). This sequence of events—his current position and his previous role—establishes a temporal connection between the two sentences.
 The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange . ||| While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that the issue exploded this year due to a federal Bureau of Investigation investigation leading to charges of widespread trading abuses at various institutions. The second sentence explains that despite not being specifically mentioned in the FBI charges, dual trading became a focus of efforts to tighten industry regulations. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the emergence of the issue (first sentence) is contingent upon the broader context of industry regulations (second sentence). The emergence of the issue led to specific actions taken due to the investigation and the resulting regulatory focus.
 While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations . ||| Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that despite not being specifically mentioned in the FBI charges, dual trading became a focus for industry efforts. The second sentence explains one reason for this focus: traders were placing buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders' customer orders. Thus, the traders' actions (placing buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders' orders) were contingent upon the broader need to tighten regulations, as described in the first sentence. The relationship is one of contingency, where the second sentence provides a cause-and-effect relationship.
 that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand ||| liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence explains how dual trading improves liquidity in the markets, specifically mentioning that traders can buy or sell even when they do not have a customer order in hand. The second sentence discusses liquidity being a significant issue for thinly traded contracts with a long waiting period. The contingency relationship is established because the improvement in liquidity (first sentence) is contingent upon the difficulty in trading thinly traded contracts (second sentence). In other words, the improvement in liquidity is a consequence of the limited trading options available to traders.
 The study , by the CFTC 's division of economic analysis , shows that `` a trade is a trade ||| Whether a trade is done on a dual or non-dual basis `` does n't seem to have much economic impact . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that a study by the CFC's division of economic analysis concludes that a trade is indeed a trade. The second sentence provides more detail about what the study concludes, specifically that a trade that is done on a dual or non-dividend basis does not have significant economic impact. This additional information expands on the initial statement by specifying the nature of the study and its conclusions, thus deepening our understanding of the study's findings.

The second sentence provides more specific details about one of those bills, namely the House's bill, which aims to prohibit dual trading in markets with daily volume of 7,000 contracts or more. This detail expands upon the initial statement by giving a concrete example of the restrictions mentioned, thus forming an expansion relationship.
 The House 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more , . ||| The Senate bill would force the CFTC to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence outlines the specifics of the House's bill, which prohibits dual trading in markets with significant daily volume. The second sentence details another bill, the Senate bill, which imposes a penalty on the CFC if it fails to show its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence broadens the scope of the discussion from the specifics of the House's bill to include another bill related to the same topic (double trading in markets). It provides additional information about the broader topic of dual trading in markets, expanding on the initial topic introduced in the first sentence.
 So far , one test of restricting dual trading has worked well . ||| The Chicago Merc banned dual trading in its Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in 1987 . Under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers . Traders who stand on the pit 's top step , where most customer orders are executed , ca n't trade for themselves . A Merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that one test of restricting dual trading has worked well so far. The second sentence provides specific details about what this test entails: traders must decide before the session begins to trade for their own account or for customers, which has not significantly affected liquidity in the Merc. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more information about the nature of the test mentioned, explaining how the rule has not affected liquidity.
 The Chicago Merc banned dual trading in its Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in 1987 . ||| Under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange banned dual trading in its S&P 500 stock futures pit in 1987. The second sentence explains what the rules say about traders making trades before a session starts, specifying that they must decide whether to trade for their own account or for customers. The contingency relationship is evident because the rule mentioned in the second sentence (the rule) is contingent upon the action taken by the traders (deciding before a session starts). The rules are a direct response to the prohibition mentioned in the first sentence.
 Under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers . ||| Traders who stand on the pit 's top step , where most customer orders are executed , ca n't trade for themselves .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence outlines the rules for traders, specifically mentioning that they can decide before a session whether they trade for their own account or for customers. The second sentence provides additional context about what traders can do when they stand on the pit's top step, which is typically the top point of customer orders, indicating that they cannot trade for themselves. This additional information expands on the initial statement by specifying a specific aspect of the trading behavior that is not affected by the rules. Thus, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first one.
 `` Dual trading is definitely worth saving ||| It adds something to the market .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that dual trading is considered worth saving. The second sentence explains why this is so by stating "It adds something to the market."

 But only two-thirds of Lexus dealers are constructing new buildings according to the Lexus specs . ||| Some are even coming up with their own novel designs .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that only two-thirds of Lexus dealers are building new buildings according to Lexus standards. The second sentence introduces some new ideas or designs being developed. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence broadens the scope of the discussion from building new buildings to include developing new designs, which is a specific example of the type of projects Lexus dealers are considering.
 Yet some dealers have turned down Infiniti or Lexus franchises because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements . ||| Infiniti `` was a bear on interiors '' but at least let him retrofit an existing building -- without the stream|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence indicates that some dealers rejected Autoins and Lexus franchises due to their inability or inability to meet design requirements. The second sentence presents an alternative scenario where Infiniti is seen as a bear on interiors but offers to retrofit an existing building without the expense of installing the new one. The comparison relationship is evident as the second sentence contrasts the situation described in the first sentence with the alternative scenario described in the first sentence. It highlights the difference between the two situations.
 PRODUCTS DON'T have to be first to be winners . ||| That 's the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that products don't need to be first in order to become successful.

The second sentence explains that due to patent protection, Diagnostica decided to cut the cassette further, limiting it to just a paperclip. The decision to cut the cassette further was contingent upon the situation described in the first sentence. The company's decision to cut the tape further was a direct response to the situation described.
 Blocked by patent protection from following suit , Dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in half again -- . ||| By 1979 , designers and engineers at Dictaphone , a Pitney Bowes subsidiary , had produced a working model of a `` picocassette '' recorder .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that Diptyno was prevented from taking legal action against a cassette and decided to cut it again in 1979. The second sentence provides information about the progress of the prototype of a "picotape" recording by the time 1979. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that the prototype of the "picotape" recording was produced by the engineers and engineers at Pantry Bowes, which was a step further from the prohibition mentioned in the first sentence. The production of the model was contingent upon the decision to cut the cassette and cut it again, showing how the company's decision was influenced by the constraints imposed by patent protection.
 Dictaphone went ahead and introduced the pico in 1985 , but it has n't sold well . ||| To date , it has `` broken even or shown a small loss . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Dynamic Audio introduced the Picop in 1985 but it hasn't sold well.

This detail expands on the initial statement by giving concrete examples of the replacement bed frames, thus providing more information about the product's performance and the specifics of the installation.
 Living there for six years was really scary . ||| The ghosts of the past are everywhere|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that living in a certain location for six years was very scary. The second sentence introduces the presence of ghosts of the past. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the presence of ghosts (second sentence) is contingent upon the scary experience of living there (first sentence). The ghosts' presence makes the living conditions very difficult.
 Some can be bought off relatively cheaply . ||| During the Korean War , Gen. Douglas MacArthur demanded and got , in addition to his U.N. command in Korea , his own naval command in Japan , NavforJapan .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence makes a general statement suggesting that some unspecified entities can be bought off relatively cheaply. The second sentence provides a specific example of such a situation through General Marshall's request for his own naval command during the Korean War. This example serves to expand on the general statement made in the first sentence by offering a concrete instance of a person (General Marshall) obtaining a naval command in a difficult situation. Thus, the second sentence expands the idea presented in the first one by offering a concrete instance of a situation where someone was able to be bought off relatively cheaply.
 , so we created the Southern Command in Panama . ||| The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder 's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the Southern Command was established in Panama. The second sentence provides additional context about the expansion of the Southern Command by mentioning that it has become even larger since the war, due to the presence of Rafaer's ghost in the Eggle Ring. This additional information expands on the initial statement about the formation of the Command, explaining how the presence of Rafaer's ghost influences its size and impact. Therefore, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first one.
 because Raeder 's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega ||| The Command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act 's six points , Cap Weinberger 's seven points , the Intelligence Committee 's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson 's 14 points necessary to justify U.S. support .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that Rafale's ghost often appears to run through the EX chamber, similar to the character of General Noriega. The second sentence explains the necessity of the Command's large bureaucratic effort to analyze the status of coup leaders against specific points. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that the existence of the bureaucratic requirements (second sentence) is contingent upon the potential failure of General Noriega's character (first sentence). The need for the bureaucratic analysis is a consequence or result of the ghost's appearance in the EX chamber, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
 The Command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act 's six points , Cap Weinberger 's seven points , the Intelligence Committee 's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson 's 14 points necessary to justify U.S. support . ||| So far no one has .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines the need for the Command's large bureaucracy to evaluate the success of leaders of coups against General Noriega. The second sentence provides specific examples of the challenges faced by the same bureaucracy, including the requirements of the War Powers Act, the Breitbart Act, the Intelligence Committee, and the Westward Security Committee. These examples illustrate the challenges mentioned in the first sentence, showing how the bureaucracy is being challenged in assessing the effectiveness of the military's capabilities. Therefore, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, as the situation described in the first sentence is contingent upon the challenges faced by the bureaucracy.
 George Marshall 's ghost is much more difficult to keep happy . ||| We keep a lot of shrines to him around the Pentagon : statues , busts , relics and such .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that George Marshall's ghost is much harder to keep happy. The second sentence provides additional information about how this is achieved: they keep shrines to him around the Pentagon, including statues, statues, and symbols. This additional detail expands on the idea that keeping him happy is particularly difficult due to his ghostly presence, illustrating how he is able to maintain his affection and presence around the Pentagon. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more context and detail about the difficulty mentioned.
 We keep a lot of shrines to him around the Pentagon : statues , busts , relics and such . ||| The Army headquarters on the third deck of the Pentagon used to burn a lot of incense to him|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that people keep shrines to him around the Pentagon, including statues, statues, statues, and statues. The second sentence provides a specific example of this behavior: the Army headquarters on the third floor of the Pentagon used to burn opium to honor him. This example expands on the initial statement by illustrating how people can honor him by donating gifts and decorations to him. Thus, the second sentence expands the information provided in the first sentence by giving a concrete instance of the behavior described.
 but the Navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it . ||| , Marshall had this thing about the Navy and the Marines -- he wanted to make them part of the Army .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that the Navy headquarters made a decision to stop something, suggesting a situation where they were unable to proceed. The second sentence explains a specific situation that led to this decision: General Sherman had a particular desire about merging the Navy and the Marines with the Army. This desire was contingent upon the Navy headquarters' decision to stop something, illustrating a cause-and-effect relationship where the action (stopping something) was a direct result of the Navy's stance.
 Which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all -- the ghost of the shah of Iran . ||| When the shah died , President Carter was so scared that the shah 's ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the Carter Doctrine .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence introduces the idea that the ghost of the shah of Iran is the worst and most hateful ghost of all time. The second sentence provides context for this idea by describing President Carter's fear when the shah's ghost died, specifically his fear that he would blame him for pushing him out of power to gain power. This fear led to President Carter's decision to declare the Reagan doctrine, which exemplifies the worst and most hateful ghost mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving a specific instance of the worst-horse spirit being mentioned.
 When the shah died , President Carter was so scared that the shah 's ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the Carter Doctrine . ||| Mr. Carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab Iran .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that when the shih's ghost died, President Reagan was fearful that he would blame him for obstructing him to leave Iran. The second sentence expands on this fear by specifying what President Reagan's declaration was: he would go to war to prevent anyone from attempting to take control of Iran. This detail further explains the extent of President Reagan's fear mentioned in the first sentence, thus forming an expansion relationship.
 But that ghost was n't fooled ||| he knew the RDF was neither rapid nor deployable nor a force --|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that the ghost was not fooled, suggesting a lack of understanding or understanding. The second sentence explains a reason for this lack of understanding: the RDF was not fast and deployable, nor was it a force. Thus, the reason for the ghost's lack of foolage (first sentence) is contingent upon the fact that the RDF was not a force (second sentence). The contingency relationship is established because the second sentence provides a justification for the claim made in the first sentence.
 I saw what he did to them firsthand . ||| It made my shoelaces dance with terror .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the speaker witnessed the abuse he faced directly. The second sentence provides additional information about the emotional impact of this experience, specifically that it made the speaker feel terrified.

This connection shows an expansion of the emotional impact mentioned in the first sentence.
 Why , he used to lay in wait for Cap ||| suddenly he 'd leap from behind some statue of Marshall onto Cap 's chest|||Temporal|||Temporal|||The first sentence describes an event where the subject was sat in wait for Camp. The second sentence describes a subsequent action: the subject would jump from a statue of Marshall onto Camp's chest. The temporal relationship is evident because the jump happened after the initial event of sat in wait, indicating a sequence of events over time.
 Cap added four more divisions to the Army , two active and two reserve ; two carrier groups to the Navy ; a division -- equivalent to the Marines ; and the C-5B , KC-10 , C-17 and a thousand tactical aircraft to the Air Force . ||| He bought $ 4 billion in prepositioning ships and $ 7 billion in ammo and equipment to fill them , and parked them at a new $ 6 billion base at Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence outlines several actions taken by Mr. Cutler, including adding more divisions to the Army, carrier groups, and military units. The second sentence details specific actions taken by Mr. Cutler, including purchasing prepositioning ships and purchasing equipment. These actions serve to expand upon the overall plan described in the first sentence, providing concrete examples of the actions taken. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds more detail to the overall plan described in the first.
 Marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers ||| They had fun moving the carriers around|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence indicates that Marshall believed training would be beneficial for certain soldiers. The second sentence describes an action taken by the soldiers: moving the carriers around. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the soldiers' enjoyment of moving the carriers is contingent upon Marshall's belief that training would be beneficial for them. The action taken (moving the carriers around) is a direct result of Marshall's belief in the benefits of training.
 Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' ||| Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence describes an event where Ezekiel's ghost came to visit and made a comment about planning a land war in Asia. The second sentence introduces the character of "Packet," who was easy-going and later left. The comparison relationship is established through the contrast between the initial statement and the character's later actions, highlighting the difference in character and the character's later actions.
 On the other hand , Mr. Cheney retained all those new land forces . ||| Marshall 's ghost is satisfied for now|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that Mr. Cheney retained all new land forces. The second sentence indicates that Walker's ghost is now satisfied.

The existence of the ghost is a consequence or result of the land holdings, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
 What with Halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming , more and more Pentagon bureaucrats are crawling under their desks . ||| They know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that due to the upcoming Halloween and the looming military cuts, more Pentagon officials are becoming more cautious and are avoiding potential cuts. The second sentence explains a reason for this behavior: the Pentagon officials believe they can only hold onto ships and ships for a short time. Thus, the officials' cautious behavior (crowding under desks) is contingent upon their belief that they can only hold onto ships and ships for a short period. Their cautious stance is a direct response to the situation described in the first sentence.

''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that the commissary's office ordered Mr. Paul to sell the paintings within six months. The second sentence explains the reasons for the acquisitions, stating they were "inherently unsafe, unsound, and unethical." The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the order from the commissary's office (calling for a stop and giving him six months) is contingent upon the reasons provided by Mr. Paul (the acquisitions being "inherently unsafe, unsound, and unethical). The decision to call for a stop and sell the paintings was a direct result of the commission's decision to call for a stop and sell the paintings.
 `` The last six months has established the quality of the collection . ||| There 's no fire sale here . ''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that the last six months have established the quality of the collection. The second sentence asserts that there is no fire sale in the collection. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the assertion about the quality of the collection (second sentence) is contingent upon the fact that the last six months have established it (first sentence). The assertion about the quality is a consequence or result of the last six months, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
 Paintings are just part of the picture . ||| Although Mr. Paul has pared a $ 1.35 billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $ 900 million since April , the high-yield debt market has plummeted .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that painting is just part of a larger picture, suggesting there are other aspects or issues that are contributing to a larger picture.

 Although Mr. Paul has pared a $ 1.35 billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $ 900 million since April , the high-yield debt market has plummeted . ||| Divesting itself of what is left , as is required of all thrift institutions by July 1994 under the new federal S&L bailout law , may well prove difficult .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence outlines the situation where Mr. Paul has reduced his junk-bond portfolio to less than $1.5 billion since April 1994, and the high-yield bond market has fallen. The second sentence discusses the difficulty of distancing itself of the remaining assets, as required by the new federal S&L bailout law. The contingency relationship is established because the difficulty in distancing oneself from the remaining assets (second sentence) is contingent upon the broader economic challenges faced by the same institution (first sentence). The difficulty in distancing itself is a direct result of the economic conditions described in the first sentence.
 And CenTrust has other problems . ||| Late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock -- .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Conentrust has other problems. The second sentence provides specific details about one of those problems: federal regulators ordered Conentrust to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock.

'|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that collectors do not equate something with "Van Gogh" anymore. The second sentence provides a specific example of this characterization by describing how collectors refer to a money payment from Johnny Pattison for his work as "a $55 million" and asserts that $10 million is indeed too much for their needs. This example expands on the initial statement by illustrating the broader point made in the first sentence, illustrating the broader point with a concrete instance.

' '' ||| Mr. Paul denies phoning and gloating .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence indicates a condition or action taken by someone, specifically mentioning that they must come to their house in Florida. The second sentence introduces Mr. Paul's denial of pinging and gimmicking. The comparison relationship is established through the contrast between the action of pinging and gimmicking, suggesting that while the speaker acknowledges the need to come to their house, the speaker is not expressing any emotion or desire for the visit. This contrast highlights the difference between the action taken and the denial of the visit.
 Mr. Paul denies phoning and gloating . ||| `` It 's just not true , '' he says .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Mr. Paul denies phoning and gimmicking, implying that he is not using a particular method or method. The second sentence provides more detail about what Mr. Paul means by "It just isn't," indicating that phoning and gimmicking is not true.

The second sentence indicates that people were interested in seeing him.

The desire to attract interest in old masters led to the desire to build up interest in the collection, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.

The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying that there is a dispute over the Rubens' authenticity. This detail further explains the context of the controversy mentioned in the first sentence, providing additional information about the nature of the dispute. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information presented in the first one.
 scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens ||| It may have been painted instead by a Rubens associate .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that there is doubt about the authenticity of the Rubens painting.

The second sentence discusses the inclusion of percentages that do not account for the many paintings that go unappealing at auction. These two sentences form a comparison because they contrast Salomon's data with the non-participation of the paintings. By mentioning the non-participation of the paintings, the text implicitly compares the fact that the figures do not include the many paintings going unavoidable.

The second sentence provides information about estimates being based on previous works sold at auction and current market conditions, noting they are not affected by the potential buyer's knowledge. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the speaker's observation that the lack of conflict of interest is contingent upon the fact that estimates are based on previous works and market conditions, not by the potential buyer. The second sentence explains a consequence or result of the first, indicating a contingent relationship.

The second sentence states that he still wants AMR. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because Mr. Trump's decision to step back and wait for the dust to settle is contingent upon his desire for AMR. His action (stepping back and waiting) is influenced by his desire for AMR (the same thing as the dust). His desire for AMR is a direct result of his ongoing efforts to maintain his position and wait for the dust to settle.
 But others remained skeptical . ||| `` I was never sure Donald Trump really wanted to take AMR , '' said John Mattis , a bond analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence indicates that there were people who were cautious or skeptical. The second sentence provides a specific example of someone who was skeptical: John Perkins, a bond analyst, who expressed his doubt about Donald Trump's intentions to take AMR.

The second sentence provides information about the success of the first UAL deal, noting that Capital Bank and Chase couldn't raise $7.2 billion. The comparison relationship is evident because the second sentence contrasts the financial requirements of the group with the success of the first UAL deal, highlighting the difference in financial resources required for the first UAL deal.
 Nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next 48 hours despite the hopes of many traders . ||| The group 's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that the group is unlikely to present a revised offer within the next 48 hours, despite the hopes of many traders. The second sentence explains that the group's advisers want to ensure firm bank commitments during the second round. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the advisers' desire to ensure firm bank commitments is contingent upon the group's inability to make a revised offer within the specified timeframe. The advisers' decision to make a commitment is a direct response to the group's situation, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
 they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes ||| If they were to insist on a low bid of , say $ 200 a share , the board might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that pilots are crucial for any sale or restructuring due to their ability to refuse to fly the airplanes. The second sentence explains a situation where a low bid from the board would not be possible if they were to agree to a higher offer from other bidders, causing banks to hesitate to finance a transaction. The contingency relationship is established because the situation described in the second sentence (the board's inability to secure a higher offer) is contingent upon the pilots' refusal to fly the airplanes mentioned in the first sentence.
 Also , because UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL executives have joined the pilots ' bid , the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders . ||| That could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence explains a situation where UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL executives have joined the pilots' bid, leading to the board being forced to exclude him from its discussions to be fair to other bidders. The second sentence discusses the potential consequence of this situation: losing the opportunity to influence and possibly join the winning bidder. The contingency relationship is established because the potential loss of influence (second sentence) is contingent upon the board's decision to exclude him (first sentence). The board's action is a direct response to the situation described in the first sentence.
 The bill , , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget . ||| to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence outlines a restriction placed on the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by a bank or thrift that would not be refunded federal budget.

 Absent other working capital the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets . ||| We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the RTC would have to delay other thrift resolutions until cash can be sold off the bad assets. The second sentence explains a condition under which the RTC would need to wait until they have collected the assets before proceeding. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the delay in other thrift resolutions (second sentence) is contingent upon the RTC's need to collect the assets (first sentence). In other words, the RTC's need to wait until the assets have been collected is dependent on the RTC's financial situation.
 That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of draconian ||| `` The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence introduces a proposal from Ways and Means that leads to secrecy, which appears to be a harsh stance. The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying what this secrecy looks like: the RTC needs to pay a price for prior consultation on the House. This further explains the nature of the secrecy mentioned in the first sentence, providing additional detail about the nature of the secrecy and the need for such consultation. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more information about the nature of secrecy.

The second sentence mentions that other brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch & Co., were also considering new ad strategies.

 `` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial . ||| It would have been too late to think about on Friday .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence states the absolute necessity of maintaining dialogue.The second sentence expresses a viewpoint that it would have been too late to consider this matter on Friday. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the absolute necessity of maintaining dialogue with the perceived inadequacy of considering it on Friday. The speaker implies that retaining the dialogue is crucial for maintaining it, thereby comparing it to the perceived inadequacy of considering it on Friday.
 It would have been too late to think about on Friday . ||| We had to think about it ahead of time .

The second sentence explains one reason for these problems: these investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use them as collateral for loans.

The second sentence provides specific details about one of these circuit breakers: if the Dow Jones index falls by 250 points in a day, the exchange will shut trading for one hour. This detail expands upon the initial statement by specifying one of the specific circuit breakers mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first one by giving more specific information about the type of circuit breakers that were adopted.

The second sentence details the conditions under which the exchange will close for an additional two hours. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence broadens the scope of the trading event beyond the initial halt mentioned in the first sentence. It provides additional information about the conditions under which the exchange will be closed, which complements the initial description of trading halts.
 It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic . ||| A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself . But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that there is uncertainty about whether a certain theory is true. The second sentence explains a potential consequence of a temporary stoppage of trading, specifically that it may deter a selling panic from spreading and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the second sentence providing a potential consequence (deterring panic and leading to more abrupt prices) that is contingent upon the uncertainty expressed in the first sentence. The potential outcome (deterring panic) is dependent on the condition (stopping trading) that is not a true theory.
 What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds . ||| The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index .

The following sentences provide specific details about the events that led up to the Friday's closing of futures markets and the impact on the New York Stock Exchange.

The second sentence details the behavior of options markets, specifically mentioning that they stopped trading in many securities. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence broadens the context by providing additional information about another sector's activity (optional markets) that was not mentioned in the first sentence. It offers a broader picture of the market conditions during the exchanges' shutdown.
 Options markets stopped trading in many securities . ||| The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence states that Options markets stopped trading in many securities. The second sentence mentions that the New York Stock Exchange, under its own rules, continued trading.

 With nowhere else to go , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange . ||| As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply .|||Temporal|||Temporal|||The first sentence indicates that sellers, including program traders, concentrated their selling efforts on the New York Stock Exchange. The second sentence explains that when liquidity on that market weakened, prices fell sharply.

The need for a change in the structure of these markets is a direct result of the complex nature of the market.
 Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions . ||| It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that standard circuit breakers would not have prevented a decline in prices on Friday but would have made for smoother, less volatile executions. The second sentence introduces a specific action taken by the exchanges and the SEC regarding joint conditions for stopping trading or staying open. This action is contingent upon the situation described in the first sentence, as it is proposed to address the issue of joint trading conditions. The need for joint trading conditions arises from the broader context of the market conditions being discussed.
 It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open . ||| Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence proposes a recommendation for the exchanges and the SEC to agree on joint conditions for stopping trading or staying open. The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying what should happen instead: one market should shut down for 30 minutes after a significant decline, and another should shut down for an hour after a significant decline. This additional detail clarifies the broader context of the proposed conditions, hence the expansion relationship.
 The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies . ||| Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission which , with the SEC , regulates the Chicago stock-index markets be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines the general agreement required for rules to be established by officials of affected exchanges and with the approval of government regulatory agencies. The second sentence discusses a potential issue if the SEC and Commodities Futures Trading Commission cannot agree, specifically by the Treasury secretary's decision. The comparison lies in contrasting the general agreement mentioned in the first sentence with the potential for resolution if specific conditions are not met. This highlights how the relationship between the two sentences is comparative, as they highlight the difference in how the rules should be enacted.

The second sentence discusses the potential impact of specialists' actions on stock prices, suggesting they cannot prevent a major crack in prices alone. The comparison lies in contrasting the expected outcome of specialists staying (despite criticisms) with the actual outcome (a major crack in stock prices). This contrast highlights the difference in the expected outcomes for the specialists in terms of their capital positions.
 Of course , specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices . ||| Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that specialists' actions cannot prevent a major crack in stock prices. The second sentence provides a specific example of this situation through the closure and opening of stock trading in some stocks early and late due to sell orders. This example expands on the general statement made in the first sentence by illustrating how the lack of a major crack in stock prices can be observed in practice. Thus, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first one by offering a concrete instance of the situation.

The second sentence explains that many employers are moving to southern countries like Spain and Italy, where wages are low and unions weak. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the unions' hesitant behavior (to move) is contingent upon the economic conditions in these regions (low wages and weak unions). The decision to move is a direct response to the economic conditions described.
 Many employers have already begun moving to southern countries such as Spain and Italy , ||| demand for trained labor and managers will rise there|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that many employers have started moving to southern countries like Spain and Italy.

The relationship indicates that the reason for employers moving is directly related to the rising demand for skilled labor and managers.

 The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government 's equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion . ||| The federal government has had to pump in $ 2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the FHA lost $4.2 billion in fiscal 1988, and the government's equity in the VA's reserve fund decreased to zero. The second sentence provides additional details about the financial situation of the VA, specifically mentioning the need for federal government funding to maintain the VA housing program and the additional request for additional money for the fiscal year ended in 1984. This additional information expands on the financial situation of the VA, explaining the specific financial challenges it faced, thus forming an expansion relationship.
 In its nicely produced publication `` Where Will Our Children Live ? '' the NAHB does acknowledge that `` of course , the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided by the federal government . '' ||| It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation , particularly zoning and building fees , which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income people .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the ANC acknowledges the inability of the federal government to provide a full measure of housing affordability for children. The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining one reason for the ANC's acknowledgment: local government regulation, particularly zoning and building fees, reduces the cost of housing out of reach for low-income and middle-income people. This additional information deepens our understanding of the ANC's acknowledgment, hence the expansion relationship.
 The association , a majority of whose 156,000 members build fewer than 25 units a year , is like many other business lobbies . ||| It treads in two worlds|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the association, with a majority of its members, builds less than 25 units annually. The second sentence explains that the association operates in two worlds, referring to it as "two worlds." This suggests that the association's operations are not isolated to its members, as it is characterized by a small number of units. Therefore, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, as it provides additional context or elaboration on the nature of the association's operations.
 The builders like the subsidies , but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues , such as the balanced-budget amendment . '' ||| Unfortunately , the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines the stance of the builders towards subsidies but also mentions their fiscal conservative views on major issues, such as the balanced-budget amendment. The second sentence discusses the organization's struggle to balance its desire for pork with its commitment to fiscal responsibility. The comparison lies in contrasting the organizations' preferences and actions in relation to pork, highlighting the difference in their approaches to fiscal responsibility.
 Unfortunately , the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility . ||| Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $ 19 billion omnibus housing bill , the organization `` basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the organization's desire for pork often overshadows its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility. The second sentence provides a specific example of this overarching issue: the NHB lobbying for the $19 billion interstate housing bill, which the organization dropped out of the taxpayers' coalition. This instance serves as an expansion or elaboration of the general statement made in the first sentence, illustrating how the organization's desire for pork can overshadow its commitment to fiscal responsibility.
 : `` Government is not going to solve the problem ... . ||| The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that government will not solve the problem. The second sentence expands on what the real key is: having the economy working and interest rates down. This further clarifies the nature of the problem being discussed, hence the expansion relationship. The second sentence provides additional detail about the nature of the problem that is not being solved by government, thus expanding on the initial statement.
 The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . '' ||| More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy ; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence outlines the real key to maintaining the economy and interest rates down. The second sentence discusses the negative effects of increased funding for HUD and local housing markets, including the inability of municipalities to absorb the negative effects of their policies. The contingency relationship is established because the second sentence presents a consequence or outcome (insisting local housing markets) that is contingent upon the condition (insisting the local governments). In other words, the negative effects of increased funding are a consequence of the economic conditions described in the first sentence.
 More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy ; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies . ||| Is this what the home builders want ?|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines the negative outcomes of increased funding for HUD, including economic destabilization and economic damage. The second sentence questions whether home builders actually want more money to protect themselves from negative impacts from their housing policies. The comparison lies in contrasting the expected benefits of increased funding with the desired outcomes for home builders. This contrast highlights the difference between what is expected (more money) and what is desired (protection from negative impacts).
 The latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke T. Boone Pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade . ||| When asked `` What went wrong ? '' the unfortunate victim replied , `` It was a combination of things . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence makes a comparison between the recent crew cut in the equities markets and a joke about a man who was knocked over by the parade. The second sentence provides a specific example of this comparison through the quote from T. John Pound, where he elaborates on the incident by explaining what happened when he was asked about something. This detailed account expands on the initial comparison, illustrating the point made in the first sentence. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
 The ceremonies began Friday afternoon when word spread that the UAL buy-out was collapsing . ||| Although the union-bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that the ceremonies started on Friday afternoon due to the spreading news about the UAL buy-out being crashing. The second sentence explains that despite the union-bidders' efforts to secure less cash, there is a growing fear among arbitragers that the era of high-risk takeovers is ending. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the context that the events (the events on Friday and Saturday) are contingent upon the fear mentioned in the first sentence. The crashing of the buy-out and the lack of cash-related offers are a direct result of the fear mentioned.
 Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses . ||| UAL , , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that deal stocks led the market down and they absorb the most losses. The second sentence provides specific details about one such deal: UAL, which is a deal aggregator, experienced a decline in price from its previous close on Monday. This detail expands on the general statement in the first sentence by giving a concrete example of a deal that benefited from the market downturn. Therefore, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first sentence.
 UAL , , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close . ||| AMR opened Monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20 % from Thursday 's close .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence provides information about UAL's stock performance on Monday, noting a decrease in value compared to the previous day. The second sentence details another stock, AMR, also experiencing a decline, but at a different price, a nearly 20% decrease from the previous day. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence broadens the context by providing additional information about another stock's performance during the same period, complementing the information about UAL's stock performance.
 UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close . AMR opened Monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20 % from Thursday 's close . Both took further hits yesterday . Hilton lost 20 % on Friday ||| Paramount lost almost 11 %|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that UAL experienced a decline in its stock price on Monday, down about 20% from Thursday's close. The second sentence provides additional information about the stock market movement by mentioning that both companies experienced further declines on Friday. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence broadens the scope of the financial market's movements beyond just UAL and AMRA to include UAL and Paramount.
 If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for policy makers ? ||| After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence discusses the finding that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused a negative impact on financial policymakers. The second sentence discusses a potential outcome for policymakers if the stock market reacts negatively to the collapse of the UAL deal. The contingency relationship is established because the potential impact on policymakers (second sentence) is contingent upon the market's reaction to the collapse of the UAL deal (first sentence). The potential consequences for policymakers depend on the outcome of the concerns found.
 After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators . ||| Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington 's bashing of Wall Street ?|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence outlines a scenario where the stock market's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might validate regulators' anti-bond direction. The second sentence questions whether private markets are actually recognizing Washington's actions against Wall Street. The contingency relationship is established because the question in the second sentence is contingent upon the context provided in the first sentence: the potential validation of Washington's actions by private markets is based on the expectation that the market's response might validate regulators' intentions.
 The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings . ||| The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence outlines a principle: the nation's economic interests are better served if private interests are the sole judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings. The second sentence discusses recent difficulties in junk-bond markets and the shortage of bank capital for recent deals, which underscores the importance of allowing free markets to operate. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence builds upon the principle introduced in the first sentence by providing additional context about the economic challenges faced in the market. It expands on the implications of the principle introduced in the first sentence.
 while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily ||| If you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence indicates that the managers of prospective targets sat gleefully and expressed excitement. The second sentence discusses the potential benefits of a timely and effective relief from the marketplace if one aligns with the vested managers. The comparison lies in contrasting the enthusiasm and enthusiasm of the vested managers with the potential benefits of a timely and effective relief from the marketplace. This contrast highlights the difference in the benefits of a timely and effective response from the marketplace compared to the immediate intervention of the vested managers.
 If you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington . ||| If you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators , .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines a condition under which one aligns with the leveraged managers: they must concede that swift and effective relief from takeover excesses is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington. The second sentence presents a condition under which one supports arbitragers and raiders, suggesting a similar level of risk to being protected from regulators. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the potential benefits of supporting arbitragers and raiders with the potential risks faced by private investors and raiders, highlighting the difference in risk based on the leveraged managers and the market.
 , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm . ||| Any such attempt to distinguish `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , , is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that actual legislation would likely have significant negative effects. The second sentence explains one reason for this potential negative impact: any attempt to distinguish good debt from bad debt or draw a line at a specific industry would likely reduce the benefits for equity markets and economic efficiency. Thus, the second sentence provides a contingent reason for the expected negative effects mentioned in the first sentence, establishing a contingent relationship.
 Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning , with the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising 618.69 points to close the morning session at 35087.38 . ||| The index slid 647.33 points , or 1.8 % , on Monday .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence states that Tokyo share prices rebounded early morning, with the Nikkei index increasing by 618.69 points to close at 357.38. The second sentence provides information about the index's movement on Monday, noting a 1.8% drop. The comparison relationship is evident as the text contrasts the recovery in Tokyo share prices with the decline in the index on Monday. This contrast highlights the difference in the extent of the recovery in the market over the two days.
 as our policy now is to wait and see ||| `` We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states the policy of waiting and seeing what happens. The second sentence provides more specific details about what "that" means in this context: trading moves through Europe and New York. The second sentence expands on the first by giving more information about the nature of the "wait and see" policy mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
 The market opened sharply lower , with the Nikkei average down nearly 600 after 20 minutes . ||| A midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session|||Temporal|||Temporal|||The first sentence states that the market started very low initially, with the Nikkei average decreasing nearly 600 after 20 minutes. The second sentence describes a midmorning rebound that returned the market to its normal state and eventually gained about 200 at the end of the morning session. The temporal relationship is evident because the second event (return to normal) happened after the first event (the market starting very low). This sequence of events establishes the temporal connection between the two sentences.
 The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year . ||| The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell 100.96 , or 2.7 % , to 3655.40 .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that smaller stocks in the Tokyo market's second section experienced the largest decline of the year. The second sentence provides specific details about the decline in the Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section, indicating that it fell by a specific percentage. This detailed information expands on the initial statement about the biggest decline, offering concrete evidence of the decline. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.

The second sentence introduces a different event, the Wall Street plunge on Friday and the subsequent decline in Tokyo. The comparison relationship is evident as the text contrasts the events of the New York market drop with the decline in Tokyo, highlighting the difference in market movements over time.
 Isao Ushikubo , general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust & Banking Co. , also was optimistic . ||| He described Friday 's plunge in the U.S. as a `` fleeting '' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Isotopo Ishizuku, the general manager of the investment research department at Tokyo Trust & Banking Co., expressed optimism. The second sentence expands on this optimism by explaining why he was optimistic: he described the recent drop in the U.S. market as a "familiar event" due to excessive merger and acquisition activity. This additional information deepens our understanding of the positive outlook mentioned in the first sentence, hence the expansion relationship.
 , this is the best time to buy , ||| `` Those shares which had posted gains on M&A speculation were dashed with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned , there is n't much impact . ''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that it is the best time to buy, suggesting that there are opportunities available for buying.The second sentence explains a reason for this decision: shares that had posted gains from M&A speculation were slashed with cold water, but there isn't much impact on major stocks. The second sentence provides a reason or context for the decision mentioned in the first sentence, indicating that the best time to buy is contingent upon the positive outcomes of M&A speculation.
 Other fund managers were similarly sanguine . ||| `` We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , '' said Masato Murakami , chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at Yasuda Trust & Banking Co .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that other fund managers were generally glimmery, suggesting a positive outlook or attitude. The second sentence provides more detail on this sentiment through a quote from Satoshi Murayama, who specifically states that he does not plan to adjust his asset allocation in foreign equity. This quote expands on the initial statement by giving a specific example of the positive outlook mentioned, thus deepening our understanding of the initial statement.
 We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities ||| Friday 's Wall Street decline was `` well within the range of volatility '' that Yasuda Trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that there are no plans to adjust the asset allocation in foreign equity. The second sentence provides context for this statement by stating that the Wall Street decline on Friday was well within the range of volatility that Nadir Trust plans to forecast its overseas investment strategy. This information expands on the initial statement by explaining the nature of the current plan (well within the range of volatility) and explaining its purpose (to chart its overseas investment strategy). Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by providing additional details about the current plan.
 Among other Asian and Pacific markets , Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses , with the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5 % and Singapore 's Straits Times Industrial Index down 10 % . ||| Major indexes declined more than 8 % in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5 % in Hong Kong .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Malaysia and Singapore experienced the largest losses among other Asian and Pacific markets, with specific examples of losses.

This additional detail expands on the initial statement by giving more context about the market performance in different countries, hence the expansion relationship.
 It 's pure psychology ||| `` Markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy-outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there 's no doubt that Asia is still following America 's lead . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the reason for something is pure psychology. The second sentence provides additional context by explaining why it's not geared to leveraged buyouts in the region and how Asian economies generally perform well, suggesting that they continue to follow the lead of America. This additional information expands on the initial statement by giving reasons for the pure psychology mentioned, thus deepening our understanding of the initial statement.
 Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out , they tend to go where the liquidity is ||| that even after Monday 's 10 % decline , the Straits Times index is up 24 % this year , so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Singapore suffered a hit due to people wanting to exit the market. The second sentence provides specific evidence of this trend by mentioning the rise of the Singapore Times index after a 10% decline and the general trend of investors bailing out. This detail expands on the initial statement by giving concrete evidence of Singapore's financial situation, thus providing more information to support the claim that Singapore suffered a hit.
 In Hong Kong , the Hang Seng Index fell 180.60 to finish at 2601.70 . ||| Trading was heavy at about one billion shares , compared with 473.9 million Friday .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence reports the drop in the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, specifying the exact amount lost and closing value. The second sentence provides additional information about the trading activity on the same day, noting that trading was heavy at about one billion shares, compared to 473 million shares on Friday. This additional detail expands on the context of the market conditions described in the first sentence, explaining the extent of the trading activity and its relation to the market on Friday.

 but is close ||| If New York does n't collapse , I see maybe another 5 % on the downside ,|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence indicates a close proximity or closeness. The second sentence provides a potential outcome if New York does not collapse, which is possibly another 5% on the downside. The contingency relationship is established because the potential negative outcome (maybe another 5% on the downside) is contingent upon New York not collapsing. If New York does not collapse, the speaker believes that the situation in New York is near close, leading to a possible negative outcome for the speaker.
 Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading . ||| The decline in the German Stock Index of 203.56 points , or 12.8 % , to 1385.72 was the Frankfurt market 's steepest fall ever .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange dropped significantly during heavy trading. The second sentence provides specific details about the extent of the drop: a 203.56 points decline in the German Stock Index, which is described as the largest drop ever, and the duration of the decline. This detail expands upon the initial statement about the price drop, offering concrete evidence of the drop. Therefore, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first sentence by giving more precise information about the extent of the price drop.
 but maybe the state 's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place . ||| What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general ?|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence suggests there's a possibility that the state's labyrinthine factions are causing a disarray in a significant place. The second sentence introduces a specific proposal by the state's attorney general, which is aimed at saving the earth. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the proposal by the governor (second sentence) is presented as a response to the potential disarray caused by the labyrinthine factions (first sentence). The proposal is contingent upon the disarray, suggesting a possible cause-and-effect relationship.
 The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of Conservation Voters , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment . ||| Interestingly , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines the nature of the initiative, mentioning its base of supporters, including notable organizations like the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Cancer Coalition, and the Citizens for a Better Environment. The second sentence introduces the Environmental Defense Fund, a non-governmental organization, and notes that it is not involved in this particular issue. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the broader context of the initiative with the absence of specific organizations involved in its implementation. This contrast highlights the difference in involvement between the two groups in the initiative.
 Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed . ||| The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that do n't meet the initiative 's standards .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that not only Californians would be fined, but all Americans would suffer if the thing passed. The second sentence provides specific details about the issue: the initiative prohibits the sale of crops that do not meet the initiative's standards in California. This detail expands on the initial statement by specifying what the issue entails (not meeting certain standards) and what it does (sale bans). Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information presented in the first sentence.
 The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that do n't meet the initiative 's standards . ||| Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence outlines a restriction placed on the sale of certain crops that do not meet California's standards. The second sentence describes a consequence of this restriction: Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers needing to adjust or sell their crops to avoid the California market. Thus, the need for Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers to adapt or sell their crops is contingent upon the imposed restrictions mentioned in the first sentence. The relationship is one of contingency, where the action taken (adapting or selling crops) depends on the condition (not meeting California's standards).
 As usual the green lobby 's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality . ||| Consider the greenhouse-effect provision .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the green lobby's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality. The second sentence provides a specific example of this disconnect: the greenhouse-effect provision. This example expands on the initial statement by illustrating how the green lobby's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality, thus providing more detail and supporting the original statement.
 Consider the greenhouse-effect provision . ||| The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence introduces the greenhouse-effect provision as a consideration. The second sentence provides more detail about what this proposal entails, specifically mentioning the requirement for a 40% reduction in carbon dioxide.

 The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % . ||| Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence introduces the proposed initiative and its mandate for a reduction of 40% carbon dioxide. The second sentence discusses the uncertainty around whether reductions in one state could significantly impact the global issue, referred to as a global problem. The comparison lies in contrasting the proposed reduction of 40% with the uncertainty of its global impact, highlighting the disparity between the proposed reduction and the potential impact on global issues.
 The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp . ||| He 's running for governor .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence introduces the key point of the state Attorney General's ambition of state Attorney General John Van De Kamp. The second sentence provides more specific information about what this ambition is: he is running for governor. The second sentence expands on the first by giving more detail about the nature of the governor's ambition mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds more specific information to the initial statement.
 And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits . ||| He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that something allows Mr. Van der Kamp to bypass campaign spending limits. The second sentence provides more specific information about how this is achieved: Mr. Van der Kamp can spend the legal maximum for his campaign. The second sentence expands on the first by giving concrete steps that illustrate the method Mr. Van der Kamp uses to circumvent campaign spending limits. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
 He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative on which there are no limits is gravy . ||| This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence outlines the legal maximum allowed for the individual's campaign, which is $50,000. The second sentence introduces the labeling of the initiative as "The Big Greenback," suggesting it could be a political or political maneuver. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the labeling (the Big Greenback) is contingent upon the legal limit for spending on the campaign, suggesting that the campaign's spending is a political maneuver.
 , it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through . ||| This is the state that recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that there is a possibility that something might pass through in modern California. The second sentence provides context for this possibility by mentioning that California has recently passed a specific anti-drug initiative, the Prop. 65 initiative. This information helps to explain why the passage of the legislation is considered possible in modern California, indicating that the passage of the initiative is contingent upon the state's recent passing of the anti-drug initiative.
 Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of California 's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric . ||| Of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence suggests that Mr. Van DeKal and his supporters believe the environment is a significant issue among California's population, implying they believe that such issues are not yet a common issue. The second sentence discusses the broader context of California's liberals, stating that they are not yet a nation of a certain type. The comparison relationship is established through contrasting the perceived importance of the environment with the broader acceptance of such issues by the Californians. The two sentences compare the current state of affairs with the broader acceptance of these issues.
 Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks , UAL and AMR , which each fell more than 20 % when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon . ||| UAL , the takeover stock at the center of Friday 's 190.58-point market plunge , fell 56 7/8 to 222 7/8 on nearly 2.3 million shares .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that transshipments dropped due to takeover disappointments in two airline stocks, UAL and AMR, which fell more than 20% when they reopened for trading after being suspended on Friday afternoon. The second sentence provides specific details about one of these stocks, UAL, including its price drop and the number of shares traded. This detailed information expands upon the initial statement about the drop in transshipments, offering concrete numbers to illustrate the extent of the drop. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence provides additional information to clarify the first.
 `` Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory . ||| It 's just a strange feeling .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that there was some concern about the general sloppiness of the rally and the failure of the OTC market to reach full territory. The second sentence expresses a strange feeling. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the strange feeling described in the second sentence is contingent upon the concerns mentioned in the first sentence. The strange feeling is a direct result of the concerns mentioned earlier.
 And this time , it was n't just the program traders who were responsible . ||| All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that there was a past issue where program traders were not responsible for certain actions. The second sentence explains that all selling led to stocks reaching very cheap values, which led to large investment banks and money management firms buying heavily. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that the past issue (the issue) led to the current situation where program traders were not responsible, suggesting that the current situation is contingent upon past issues.
 the `` first thing we did was to double our orders '' yesterday morning ||| `` With the market down like this , we 'll probably take another $ 50 million and put it in '' the market .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the first action was to double orders on a specific day. The second sentence expands on this by specifying that due to the market downturn, the speaker plans to take another $50 million and put it in the market. The second sentence provides additional detail about the planned actions mentioned in the first sentence, thus expanding on the initial statement.
 According to Big Board officials , Disney had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday ||| it was one of the seven stocks that could n't finish trading that day|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that according to Big Board officials, Disney experienced one of the largest sell-order imbalances on Friday. The second sentence provides additional information about one of those imbalances: it was one of seven stocks that couldn't finish trading that day.

The second sentence explains that market analysts had predicted the decline in the Dow's strength up until that point and were predicting a drop in the Dow.

The feeling of uneasyness is a direct result of the experts' opinions.

This contrast highlights the lack of detail about the potential impact of the asset sales on the total value of the two entities.

The second sentence explains how they do this: by reinforcing the notion that Blue Arrow is a distant past. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the second sentence describes an action (informing shareholders of Blue Arrow's status as a distant company) that is contingent upon the situation described in the first sentence (the potential negative impact of the moves).

The accounting standards are a consequence or result of the two ways Blue Arrow makes its earnings reports, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
 `` Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice 's wonderland , '' ||| The British version shows `` a handful of pounds of net worth '' following the 1987 write-off of good will , while the American version reflects `` $ 1 billion of net worth because almost none of the good will has been written off .

The second sentence introduces a viewpoint from some executives at Blue Arrow who believe the extent of Manpower's good will could be significant.

The need to reduce costs is a direct response to the situation described.
