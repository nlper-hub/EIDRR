The second sentence provides specific details about the composition of the opening session, mentioning Mr. Glass's movements in the two octaves and his frequent use of keys. This detail expands upon the initial information about the opening session, giving more context and specifics about the composition. Therefore, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first sentence.
 There is a recognizable musical style here , but not a particular performance style . ||| The music is not especially pianistic|||Contingency|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that there is a recognized musical style but not a specific performance style. The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying that the music is not particularly piano-oriented. This means that the second sentence provides additional detail about the lack of a specific performance style, which is part of the broader statement about the lack of a recognized musical style. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more specific information about the lack of a recognized musical style.
 indeed , it 's hard to imagine a bad performance of it ||| Nothing bravura , no arpeggios , no ticklish fingering problems challenge the performer .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that there is no reason to expect a bad performance of something. The second sentence provides specific examples of the non-violent arctic and non-typic tingling issues that the performer faces. These examples serve to expand upon the initial claim by offering concrete instances of the non-violent and non-typic elements that could cause a bad performance. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by offering concrete instances that support the assertion made in the first sentence.
 Nothing bravura , no arpeggios , no ticklish fingering problems challenge the performer . ||| We hear , we may think , inner voices , but they all seem to be saying the same thing .|||Contingency|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that no bold, arctic, or claustrophobic issues challenge the performer. The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining that while one might think creative ideas, they all seem to convey the same message. The second sentence provides additional context and elaboration on the idea introduced in the first sentence, explaining that while there are creative ideas, there are also creative ideas that can be expressed. This expansion helps to clarify the nature of the challenges faced by the performer.
 With `` Planet News , '' , '' Mr. Glass gets going . ||| His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard .|||Expansion|||Temporal|||The first sentence indicates that Mr. Glass starts typing with "Plane News."The second sentence describes his actions during this process: he is swaying his hands closer on the keyboard. The temporal relationship is evident because the action of swaying his hands (second sentence) occurs after Mr. Glass starts typing (first sentence). The sequence of events is clearly defined by the time of Mr. Glass's typing action.
 His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard . ||| Seventh chords make you feel as though he may break into a very slow improvisatory riff .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence describes the speaker's position relative to the keyboard, indicating that the speaker is positioned more in the hands of the keyboard. The second sentence describes the sensation of breaking into a slow interlude, similar to the stepping into a piano solo. The contingency relationship is evident because the speaker's feeling of breaking into a slow improvisational groove is contingent upon the speaker's observation of his hands moving more in the keyboard. The potential for a slow interlude is a consequence or result of the speaker's positioned closer position on the keyboard.
 His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard . Seventh chords make you feel as though he may break into a very slow improvisatory riff . ||| The chords modulate|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence describes the situation where the subject's hands are closer apart on the keyboard. The second sentence introduces a related detail about the manner in which his fingers move, specifically mentioning that they can be seen as slow improvisational. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence adds more information about the subject's musical style introduced in the first sentence, specifically regarding the manner in which his fingers move. This additional detail helps to expand the description of the subject's musical style.
 His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard . Seventh chords make you feel as though he may break into a very slow improvisatory riff . The chords modulate , but there is little filigree even though his fingers begin to wander over more of the keys . ||| Contrasts predictably accumulate|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence describes the situation where the subject's hands are closer apart on the keyboard, indicating a heightened sense of movement. The second sentence describes the pattern of contrasts that appear to occur, despite the subject's movements. The contingency relationship is established because the pattern of contrasts (second sentence) is contingent upon the subject's heightened position on the keyboard (first sentence). The contrast in movement is a consequence of the subject's heightened position on the keyboard.
 Contrasts predictably accumulate : First the music is loud , then it becomes soft , then you realize it becomes louder again . ||| `` The Fourth Knee Play , '' an interlude from `` Einstein on the Beach , '' is like a toccata but it does n't seem to move much beyond its left-hand ground in `` Three Blind Mice . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence describes typical contrasts that accumulate. The second sentence provides specific examples of these contrasts through the description of "The Fourth Knee Play" and its analogy to "Baby on the Beach" and the lack of movement in "Three Blind Mices." This detailed description expands on the initial statement about the inconsistent contrasts mentioned, illustrating how the music is not particularly loud or loud, thus providing more information about the initial statement.
 When Mr. Glass decides to get really fancy , he crosses his hands and hits a resonant bass note with his right hand . ||| He does this in at least three of his solo pieces .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence describes Mr. Glass's action of bending his hands and hitting a bass note with his right hand. The second sentence provides additional information about his performance, specifying that he performs this action at least three of his solo pieces. This additional detail expands on the initial description of his performance, giving more context and specifics about how he performs his performance. Therefore, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first sentence.
 He does this in at least three of his solo pieces . ||| You might call it a leitmotif or a virtuoso accomplishment .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that the individual performs at least three solo pieces in his solo pieces. The second sentence offers a possible interpretation of this performance, suggesting that one might consider it a zealous achievement or a phenomology achievement. The contingency relationship is established because the second sentence offers a possible interpretation or interpretation that is contingent upon the information provided in the first sentence. The description of the performance as a zealous achievement is based on the assumption that the individual performs in a particular way.
 Not only is the typical Glasswork open-ended , it is also often multiple in its context s . ||| `` Mad Rush '' began its life as the accompaniment to the Dalai Lama 's first public address in the U.S. , when Mr. Glass played it on the organ at New York 's Cathedral of St. John the Divine . Later it was performed on Radio Bremen in Germany , and then Lucinda Childs took it for one of her dance pieces .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the typical Glass work is open-ended and often has multiple contexts. The second sentence provides specific examples of how this general statement manifests: "Mad Rush" started as an accompaniment to the Dalai Lama's first public address in the U.S., and it was performed on Radio Brasil, where St. John's Cathedral in Germany, and later, it was performed on the St. John's Dance Piece in Lucille Childs' dance piece. This detailed information expands on the initial statement, illustrating how the typical "Mad Rush" style became a significant part of the "Mad Rush" style was implemented.
 The evening ended with Mr. Glass 's `` Metamorphosis , '' another multiple work . ||| Parts 1 , 2 , and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris 's acclaimed film , `` The Thin Blue Line , '' and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Mr. Glass ended the evening with "Measures of the Night," a multi-purpose work. The second sentence provides more detail about what happened during the evening: the credits are from the soundtrack of Erhard Morrison's best-selling film "The Thin Blue Line," and the rest are from interludes in two serialized works of the same name. This additional information expands on the initial statement about Mr. Glass's work, explaining what happened during the evening's performance. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving specific details about the origins of Mr. Glass's work.
 Parts 1 , 2 , and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris 's acclaimed film , `` The Thin Blue Line ||| When used as background in this way , the music has an appropriate eeriness , as when a two-note phrase , a descending minor third , accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports , interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence introduces the soundtrack of Erl Steinhardt's acclaimed film "The Thin Line." The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining how the music, when used in this way, evokes an unusual eerie quality, particularly when it features a two-note phrase that precedes various interviews, interviews, and confessions of witnesses. This additional information deepens our understanding of the original statement, explaining what makes the music "eerie" and providing a specific example of its characteristic. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more detail about the composition and the nature of the music's influence.
 , this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr. Glass 's music . ||| Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical Stravinsky , the genuinely radical minimalism of Berg and Webern , and what in retrospect even seems like concision in Mahler .|||Contingency|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the comparison overlooks the very cloaklike nature of Mr. Glass's work. The second sentence provides specific examples of the cloaklike nature of Mr. Glass's work, mentioning its minimalistic style, stylistic influences (Czarnobyl, Brasznik, Marxist and Mahatma) and its characteristic (as a narrator of concision). This detailed information expands on the initial claim about the cloaklike nature of Mr. Glass's work, illustrating how it is reflected in its composition.
 but indicated it intends to hold at least 20 % of the joint venture 's stock long term . ||| A 20 % stake would allow Honeywell to include Yamatake earnings in its results .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates Honeywell's intention to hold at least 20% of the joint venture's stock long term. The second sentence explains a potential benefit of holding a 20% stake, which would allow Honeywell to include Yamatake earnings in its long-term results. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the ability to include earnings in the long-term results (second sentence) is contingent upon holding a 20% stake (first sentence). In other words, the potential benefit of holding the stock is dependent on the condition that Honeywell intends to hold the stock long term.
 Overall , Honeywell reported earnings of $ 74.4 million , or $ 1.73 a share , for the three months ended Oct. 1 compared with a loss of $ 41.4 million , or 98 cents a share , a year earlier . ||| The previous period 's results included a $ 108 million pretax charge related to unrecoverable contract costs and a $ 12.3 million pretax gain on real estate sales .|||Comparison|||Expansion|||The first sentence provides information about Honeywell's earnings for the three months ended October 1, showing a rise from a loss in the previous year to a profit in the current period. The second sentence details the changes in the company's financial results for the previous period, specifically mentioning a pre-tax charge and a gain on real estate sales. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence adds more detail to the financial picture of Honeywell's financial performance during the same period, complementing the information about earnings in the first sentence.
 The previous period 's results included a $ 108 million pretax charge related to unrecoverable contract costs and a $ 12.3 million pretax gain on real estate sales . ||| Sales for the latest quarter were flat , at $ 1.72 billion .|||Expansion|||Comparison|||The first sentence explains the financial impact of the previous period on the company's results, specifically mentioning a pretax charge and a pretax gain on real estate sales. The second sentence provides information about the sales for the latest quarter, noting that they remained flat. The comparison relationship is evident because the two sentences contrast the financial outcomes of the two periods, highlighting changes in financial performance over time.
 For the nine months , Honeywell reported earnings of $ 212.1 million , or $ 4.92 a share , compared with earnings of $ 47.9 million , or $ 1.13 a share , a year earlier . ||| Sales declined slightly to $ 5.17 billion .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence provides information about Honeywell's earnings for the nine months, comparing the current period to the previous year. The second sentence discusses the decline in sales over the same period. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence adds more detail about the company's financial situation during the same period, specifically focusing on the decline in sales. This additional information helps to provide a fuller picture of Honeywell's financial performance during the period in question.
 Once again , your editorial page misstates the law to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions . ||| In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups , Michael S. Greve informs your readers , `` ... the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do ; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge '' `` Congress's Environmental Buccaneers , '' Sept. 18 . This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive , but it is simply wrong .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the editorial page misinterprets the law to conform to one's almost imperialistic skepticisms. The second sentence provides a specific example of this misinterpretation: Michael S. Greenvey explains the Clean Water Act, which outlines a specific claim about zero risk. This detailed account expands on the general misinterpretation mentioned in the first sentence, illustrating how the law is misinterpreted by the editorial page. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving a concrete instance of the misinterpretation.
 the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do ||| it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge|||Contingency|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the Clean Water Act is based on a presumption that no more than zero risk will cause harm. The second sentence provides additional information about how this presumption is implemented, specifically by setting a legal standard for zero discharge. This detail expands upon the initial statement by specifying what the presumption entails, thus providing more context and supporting the original statement.
 but it is simply wrong . ||| The Clean Water Act contains no `` legal standard '' of zero discharge .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence asserts that something is incorrect. The second sentence provides context for why this might be the case: the Clean Water Act does not provide a "legal standard" for zero discharge. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the lack of a "legal standard" (second sentence) could be a reason for the assertion that something is incorrect (first sentence). The existence of the "legal standard" is contingent upon the assertion that something is incorrect.
 The Clean Water Act contains no `` legal standard '' of zero discharge . ||| It requires that `` discharges of pollutants '' into the `` waters of the United States '' be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301 .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the Clean Water Act does not establish a "legal standard" for zero discharge. The second sentence explains what this means by specifying that "discharges of pollutants" must be authorized through permits that reflect the efflux limitations established by section 301. The second sentence expands on the first by providing more detail about the criteria under which the Clean Water Act is governed, thus deepening our understanding of the concept introduced in the first sentence.
 It requires that `` discharges of pollutants '' into the `` waters of the United States '' be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301 . ||| Whatever may be the problems with this system , it scarcely reflects `` zero risk '' or `` zero discharge . ''|||Contingency|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines a requirement for "discharges" of pollutants into the waters of the United States, which is authorized by permits that reflect the excretory limits established under section 309. The second sentence discusses the lack of clarity around the system, specifically mentioning that while some problems exist, it does not fully reflect zero risk or zero discharge. The comparison lies in contrasting the necessity of the permit requirement with the lack of clarity about its effectiveness. This contrast highlights the difference in clarity between the required permit and the actual implementation.
 Perhaps Mr. Greve was confused by Congress 's meaningless statement of `` the national goal '' in section 101 , which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges -- by 1985 , no less . ||| This fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in 1972 , and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute .|||Comparison|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates Mr. Gleeve's confusion with Congress's vague statement about the national goal in section 101, which calls for the elimination of deductments by 1985. The second sentence provides context for this confusion by stating that this statement was not seriously taken into account when it was first enacted in 1972 and that it should not be confused with the actual provisions of the statute. The contingency relationship is established because the second sentence provides a reason or context for the confusion mentioned in the first sentence. The doubt expressed by Mr. Gleeve is contingent upon the historical context provided by Congress's vague statement.
 Thus , you do the public a great disservice when Mr. Greve suggests , even facetiously , that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water ||| your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them , as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters , from the hairyknuckled knock of the Sierra Club at their doors|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that Mr. Greenvee's suggestion that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of certain beverages does not benefit the public. The second sentence explains a consequence of this situation: the readers may believe that only chance or oversight protects them from the Sierra Club's call to their homes. The contingency relationship is established because the readers' fear of being protected (second sentence) is contingent upon the premise that the Clean Water Act does not protect them (first sentence). The fear of being protected is a consequence of the premise introduced by Mr. Greenvein's suggestion.
 , the magazine just has n't kept up with the times . ||| , it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the magazine hasn't kept up with the times, suggesting a lack of innovation or growth. The second sentence expands on this idea by explaining one reason for this lack of innovation: the magazine has a reputation for being a magazine for boys who like to find sex-themed women. This further illustrates the lack of innovation mentioned in the first sentence, providing additional detail or elaboration on why the magazine hasn't kept up with the times.
 Advertisers do n't think of the magazine first ||| `` What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance .|||Contingency|||Comparison|||The first sentence indicates that advertisers do not think of the magazine first. The second sentence explains what advertisers want instead: to take an aggressive stance. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the way advertisers perceive the magazine with the intended approach, suggesting that the magazine is more focused on its content rather than its actual content.
 `` What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance . ||| People did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace , and in many ways we were n't . ''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates the intention to take a more aggressive stance.The second sentence explains a reason for this intention: people did not believe they were in tune with the marketplace, and in many cases, they weren't in tune with it. The desire to take a more aggressive stance is contingent upon the perception of not being in tune with the marketplace. The relationship is one of contingency because the action (taking a more aggressive stance) is a direct response to the perceived lack of integration.
 The 101-year-old magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before . ||| It largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics : .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that the magazine has never had to attract advertisers with significant enthusiasm before. The second sentence explains that this lack of enthusiasm was a result of its hard-to-favorable demographic. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the magazine's ability to attract advertisers (first sentence) is contingent upon its hard-to-favorable demographic (second sentence). The success of the magazine is a direct result of its inability to attract advertisers, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
 Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices -- $ , . ||| When ad dollars are tight , the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers , .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that one of the biggest factors is the high ad prices. The second sentence explains a reason for this high ad prices: when there is tight advertising budgets, the high page cost is a major barrier for advertisers. Thus, the second sentence provides a reason for the high ad prices mentioned in the first sentence, establishing a contingent relationship. The reason provided in the second sentence (high page cost) is contingent upon the situation described in the first sentence (high ad prices).
 But Ms. McCraw says the magazine is fighting back . ||| It now offers 30 regional editions , it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles , and it has been beefing up its sales force .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Ms. McCaw believes the magazine is fighting back. The second sentence provides specific actions taken by the magazine, such as offering 30 regional editions, launching ads adjacent to articles, and beefing up its sales force. These actions are examples of the aggressive tactics mentioned in the first sentence, thus expanding on the initial statement.
 The campaign , , takes advantage of the eye-catching photography that National Geographic is known for . ||| In one ad , a photo of the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris is paired with the headline , `` The only book more respected than ours does n't accept advertising . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the campaign uses the eye-catching photography that National Geographic is known for. The second sentence provides a specific example of this use of photography through an advertisement for a magazine called "Santa Fe Champale." This example expands on the initial claim by illustrating how the photography is used in a commercial, illustrating the point made in the first sentence. Thus, the second sentence expands on the idea introduced in the first sentence by offering a concrete instance of the creative use of photography.
 In one ad , a photo of the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris is paired with the headline , `` The only book more respected than ours does n't accept advertising . '' ||| Another ad pictures a tree ant , magnified 80 times , with the headline , `` For impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence presents an advertisement featuring a photo of the Sassault in Paris and a caption stating that "The only book more respected doesn't accept advertising." The second sentence further elaborates on the content of the ad by describing another ad featuring a tree ad with a caption that emphasizes the reader's size beyond the initial reach. Both sentences present different aspects of the same ad, expanding on the theme of ad content and the theme of ad placements.
 Her goal : to top 300 ad pages in 1990 , up from about 274 this year . ||| Whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines the goal of topping 300 ad pages in 1990, up from about 143 this year. The second sentence discusses the uncertainty of whether she can meet this goal. The comparison relationship is evident as the second sentence contrasts the certainty of her goal with the uncertainty of its completion. It highlights the uncertainty surrounding her ability to meet the goal, highlighting the uncertainty around her progress.
 The ad campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of National Geographic ||| `` We want it to be a '90s kind of image . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the ad campaign is intended to complement the idea of National Geographic's image. The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying what the goal is: to create a '90s type of image.' This detail clarifies the nature of the ad campaign's purpose, providing more information about its intended impact on the image. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more context about the intended outcome of the ad campaign.
 Stephen Novick , 49 , was named executive vice president , deputy creative director at Grey Advertising , New York ||| He was executive vice president , director of broadcast production .|||Temporal|||Temporal|||The first sentence states that Stephen Novak was named executive vice president, creative director, at Grey Advertising in New York. The second sentence provides information about his previous position at the agency, where he was also executive vice president of broadcast production. The temporal relationship is evident because the second sentence describes an event (his previous role at Grey Advertising) that occurred after the first event (he was named executive vice president). This sequence of events—his current position and his previous role—establishes a temporal connection between the two sentences.
 The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange . ||| While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that the issue exploded this year due to a federal Bureau of Investigation investigation leading to charges of widespread trading abuses at various institutions. The second sentence explains that despite not being specifically mentioned in the FBI charges, dual trading became a focus of efforts to tighten industry regulations. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the emergence of the issue (first sentence) is contingent upon the broader context of industry regulations (second sentence). The emergence of the issue led to specific actions taken due to the investigation and the resulting regulatory focus.
 While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations . ||| Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that despite not being specifically mentioned in the FBI charges, dual trading became a focus for industry efforts. The second sentence explains one reason for this focus: traders were placing buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders' customer orders. Thus, the traders' actions (placing buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders' orders) were contingent upon the broader need to tighten regulations, as described in the first sentence. The relationship is one of contingency, where the second sentence provides a cause-and-effect relationship.
 that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand ||| liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence explains how dual trading improves liquidity in the markets, specifically mentioning that traders can buy or sell even when they do not have a customer order in hand. The second sentence discusses liquidity being a significant issue for thinly traded contracts with a long waiting period. The contingency relationship is established because the improvement in liquidity (first sentence) is contingent upon the difficulty in trading thinly traded contracts (second sentence). In other words, the improvement in liquidity is a consequence of the limited trading options available to traders.
 The CFTC may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions . ||| The agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed , but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them .|||Contingency|||Expansion|||The first sentence indicates that the CFC may consider certain arguments. The second sentence provides more specific information about what those arguments might be, specifically mentioning small exchanges or contracts needing additional liquidity. This additional detail expands on the initial idea of the CFC's potential consideration, hence the expansion relationship.
 The study , by the CFTC 's division of economic analysis , shows that `` a trade is a trade ||| Whether a trade is done on a dual or non-dual basis `` does n't seem to have much economic impact . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that a study by the CFC's division of economic analysis concludes that a trade is indeed a trade. The second sentence provides more detail about what the study concludes, specifically that a trade that is done on a dual or non-dividend basis does not have significant economic impact. This additional information expands on the initial statement by specifying the nature of the study and its conclusions, thus deepening our understanding of the study's findings.
 Members of Congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize CFTC operations . ||| The House 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more , .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Members of Congress have proposed restrictions on dual trading in bills to reauthorize CFC operations. The second sentence provides more specific details about one of those bills, namely the House's bill, which aims to prohibit dual trading in markets with daily volume of 7,000 contracts or more. This detail expands upon the initial statement by giving a concrete example of the restrictions mentioned, thus forming an expansion relationship.
 The House 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more , . ||| The Senate bill would force the CFTC to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence outlines the specifics of the House's bill, which prohibits dual trading in markets with significant daily volume. The second sentence details another bill, the Senate bill, which imposes a penalty on the CFC if it fails to show its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence broadens the scope of the discussion from the specifics of the House's bill to include another bill related to the same topic (double trading in markets). It provides additional information about the broader topic of dual trading in markets, expanding on the initial topic introduced in the first sentence.
 So far , one test of restricting dual trading has worked well . ||| The Chicago Merc banned dual trading in its Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in 1987 . Under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers . Traders who stand on the pit 's top step , where most customer orders are executed , ca n't trade for themselves . A Merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that one test of restricting dual trading has worked well so far. The second sentence provides specific details about what this test entails: traders must decide before the session begins to trade for their own account or for customers, which has not significantly affected liquidity in the Merc. Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more information about the nature of the test mentioned, explaining how the rule has not affected liquidity.
 The Chicago Merc banned dual trading in its Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in 1987 . ||| Under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange banned dual trading in its S&P 500 stock futures pit in 1987. The second sentence explains what the rules say about traders making trades before a session starts, specifying that they must decide whether to trade for their own account or for customers. The contingency relationship is evident because the rule mentioned in the second sentence (the rule) is contingent upon the action taken by the traders (deciding before a session starts). The rules are a direct response to the prohibition mentioned in the first sentence.
 Under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers . ||| Traders who stand on the pit 's top step , where most customer orders are executed , ca n't trade for themselves .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence outlines the rules for traders, specifically mentioning that they can decide before a session whether they trade for their own account or for customers. The second sentence provides additional context about what traders can do when they stand on the pit's top step, which is typically the top point of customer orders, indicating that they cannot trade for themselves. This additional information expands on the initial statement by specifying a specific aspect of the trading behavior that is not affected by the rules. Thus, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first one.
 the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit ||| It 's too soon to tell ... but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that the plan hasn't significantly affected liquidity in the pit, suggesting a lack of change or impact. The second sentence explains a reason for this lack of change: people seem not to be unhappy with it. Thus, the lack of change (first sentence) is contingent upon the lack of unhappiness (second sentence). The relationship indicates that the lack of change in liquidity is a consequence or result of the lack of unhappiness, establishing a contingent relationship.
 `` It 's too soon to tell ... but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it , '' he said . ||| He said he would n't comment on the CFTC plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal .|||Expansion|||Comparison|||The first sentence indicates uncertainty about the situation but notes that people aren't unhappy with it. The second sentence provides additional context by specifying that the individual will not comment on the CTC plan until the full proposal is seen. This detail expands on the initial statement by giving more information about the lack of unhappiness, thus deepening our understanding of the situation.
 `` Dual trading is definitely worth saving ||| It adds something to the market .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that dual trading is considered worth saving. The second sentence explains why this is so by stating "It adds something to the market."

The second sentence introduces some new ideas or designs being developed. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence broadens the scope of the discussion from building new buildings to include developing new designs, which is a specific example of the type of projects Lexus dealers are considering.
 Yet some dealers have turned down Infiniti or Lexus franchises because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements . ||| Infiniti `` was a bear on interiors '' but at least let him retrofit an existing building -- without the stream|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence indicates that some dealers rejected Autoins and Lexus franchises due to their inability or inability to meet design requirements. The second sentence presents an alternative scenario where Infiniti is seen as a bear on interiors but offers to retrofit an existing building without the expense of installing the new one. The comparison relationship is evident as the second sentence contrasts the situation described in the first sentence with the alternative scenario described in the first sentence. It highlights the difference between the two situations.
 Infiniti `` was a bear on interiors '' but at least let him retrofit an existing building -- without the stream ||| he turned down a Lexus franchise in part because `` the building was gorgeous but very expensive|||Comparison|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Infiniti was a bear on interiors but also suggested reusing an existing building instead.

The second sentence provides information about the progress of the prototype of a "picotape" recording by the time 1979. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that the prototype of the "picotape" recording was produced by the engineers and engineers at Pantry Bowes, which was a step further from the prohibition mentioned in the first sentence. The production of the model was contingent upon the decision to cut the cassette and cut it again, showing how the company's decision was influenced by the constraints imposed by patent protection.
 But others said pico should proceed . ||| Both were right .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that there were others who ruled out allowing Picop to proceed. The second sentence states that both individuals were right. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the decision of others (to allow Picop to proceed) is contingent upon the context provided in the first sentence (that others ruled out the possibility of Picop proceeding).

 That 's about all it costs to appease Adm. Erich Raeder 's ghost . ||| In 1941 , Raeder and the German navy threatened to attack the Panama Canal , so we created the Southern Command in Panama .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates a need to appease Adm. Erich Raeder's ghost. The second sentence describes an action taken in 1941, which was creating the Southern Command in Panama. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that the creation of the Southern Command was a direct response to the need to appease Raeder's ghost. The action taken (forming the Command) was contingent upon the need to appease Raeder's ghost, suggesting that the establishment of the Command was a direct response to the need to address Raeder's ghost.
 , so we created the Southern Command in Panama . ||| The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder 's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the Southern Command was established in Panama. The second sentence provides additional context about the expansion of the Southern Command by mentioning that it has become even larger since the war, due to the presence of Rafaer's ghost in the Eggle Ring. This additional information expands on the initial statement about the formation of the Command, explaining how the presence of Rafaer's ghost influences its size and impact. Therefore, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first one.
 because Raeder 's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega ||| The Command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act 's six points , Cap Weinberger 's seven points , the Intelligence Committee 's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson 's 14 points necessary to justify U.S. support .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that Rafale's ghost often appears to run through the EX chamber, similar to the character of General Noriega. The second sentence explains the necessity of the Command's large bureaucratic effort to analyze the status of coup leaders against specific points. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that the existence of the bureaucratic requirements (second sentence) is contingent upon the potential failure of General Noriega's character (first sentence). The need for the bureaucratic analysis is a consequence or result of the ghost's appearance in the EX chamber, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
 The Command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act 's six points , Cap Weinberger 's seven points , the Intelligence Committee 's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson 's 14 points necessary to justify U.S. support . ||| So far no one has .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines the need for the Command's large bureaucracy to evaluate the success of leaders of coups against General Noriega. The second sentence provides specific examples of the challenges faced by the same bureaucracy, including the requirements of the War Powers Act, the Breitbart Act, the Intelligence Committee, and the Westward Security Committee. These examples illustrate the challenges mentioned in the first sentence, showing how the bureaucracy is being challenged in assessing the effectiveness of the military's capabilities. Therefore, the second sentence is contingent upon the first, as the situation described in the first sentence is contingent upon the challenges faced by the bureaucracy.

The collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan Mr. Paul had in which the art was to do double duty -- as an investment for CenTrust and as decoration for the S&L 's new office tower , designed by I.M. Pei . The rub is that the $ 28 million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as CenTrust was losing money hand over fist . Mr. Paul had no right to buy art for the S&L in the first place -- it is n't on the comptroller 's `` permissible '' list -- without seeking a special dispensation , which he did not do . Besides that , some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of CenTrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman 's estate on La Gorce Isle off Miami Beach .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that the painting is a reminder of the problems that have dominated Connoisseur and the chairman of Connoisseur over the past two years.

'|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that collectors do not equate something with "Van Gogh" anymore. The second sentence provides a specific example of this characterization by describing how collectors refer to a money payment from Johnny Pattison for his work as "a $55 million" and asserts that $10 million is indeed too much for their needs. This example expands on the initial statement by illustrating the broader point made in the first sentence, illustrating the broader point with a concrete instance.

The second sentence provides additional information about the price paid, describing it as a record for the artist. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that the record price ($70,000) was contingent upon the purchase of the portrait by Jansz. The record price was a direct result of the portrait's high price, illustrating a contingent relationship between the two sentences.

 `` And he tells me , ` If you want to see your paintings , you 'll have to come to my house in Florida . ' '' ||| Mr. Paul denies phoning and gloating .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence indicates a condition or action taken by someone, specifically mentioning that they must come to their house in Florida. The second sentence introduces Mr. Paul's denial of pinging and gimmicking. The comparison relationship is established through the contrast between the action of pinging and gimmicking, suggesting that while the speaker acknowledges the need to come to their house, the speaker is not expressing any emotion or desire for the visit. This contrast highlights the difference between the action taken and the denial of the visit.
 Mr. Paul denies phoning and gloating . ||| `` It 's just not true , '' he says .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Mr. Paul denies phoning and gimmicking, implying that he is not using a particular method or method.

The desire to attract interest in old masters led to the desire to build up interest in the collection, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.

The second sentence, "The state veiledly mentions that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removal," further elaborates on the nature of the removal by specifying that it occurred in a subtle manner and explains the reason for doing so (removing the pictures). The second sentence expands on the first by providing additional detail about the nature of the removal, thus deepening our understanding of the removal mentioned in the first sentence.
 that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at Sotheby 's ||| that he was `` merely storing the paintings at home -- with some display -- because of the special dehumidified environment '' required for their safekeeping , until CenTrust 's new building was ready for them|||Comparison|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that at one point in time, the individual had eight or nine paintings at home and that the remaining paintings were stored at Sotheby's. The second sentence provides additional information about the situation by stating that the individual was only storing the paintings at home due to the special dehumidifier environment required for their safekeeping until the new building was ready for them. This additional detail expands on the initial statement about the individual's situation, explaining why they had these paintings stored at home and the reason for their safekeeping. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
 For instance , he got a $ 3 million loan from the S&L , negotiated at a below-market rate . ||| He owns 43 % of CenTrust 's shares .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the individual received a $3 million loan from the S&L, which was negotiated at a low market rate. The second sentence provides additional information about the ownership of Conetrust's shares, specifying that he owns 44% of Conetrust's shares.

The second sentence expands on this idea by specifying that there is a dispute over the Rubens' authenticity. This detail further explains the context of the controversy mentioned in the first sentence, providing additional information about the nature of the dispute. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information presented in the first one.
 scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens ||| It may have been painted instead by a Rubens associate .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that there is doubt about the authenticity of the Rubens painting. The second sentence introduces a potential reason for this doubt: the paint may have been painted by a Rubens associate.

''|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that removing the Rubens for a similar amount would be a difficult task. The second sentence expands on this idea by providing a reason for the difficulty: the Rubens' future value is beyond what it is likely to be, and the possibility of selling for a specific amount remains uncertain. This additional information supports and expands upon the initial claim of the difficulty in removing the Rubens, hence the expansion relationship.
 Still , predicting is tricky . ||| `` I 'm forever dumbfounded by what I see making these high prices . ''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that prediction is tricky. The second sentence provides a reason for this difficulty: the speaker is constantly being surprised by what they see as high prices. Thus, the speaker's constant fear of seeing high prices is contingent upon their constant uncertainty about their expectations. The second sentence explains a possible reason for the difficulty mentioned in the first sentence, establishing a contingent relationship.
 Jonathan H. Kress , the son of the painting 's former owner , Mrs. Rush Kress , dismisses the price talk as `` sour grapes .

Kruse, the son of Mrs. Rush Kryse's former owner, dismisses the price talk as "pittance." The second sentence explains that dealers were furious of the purchase price and were disappointed when they did not buy the Rubens. The contingency relationship is evident because Jonathan H. Kruse's dismissal of the price talk (first sentence) is contingent upon the actions of dealers (second sentence). His dismissal of the price talk is a direct response to the dealers' dissatisfaction and the subsequent disappointment.
 a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself ||| Most of them were n't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that many experts have never seen the painting itself. The second sentence provides additional information about the extent of the experts' lack of awareness: some were even born before the painting was publicly displayed. This additional detail expands on the initial statement about the experts' lack of awareness, explaining why they might have not been able to see the painting. Therefore, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first one by giving more context about the experts' lack of awareness.

The second sentence provides a specific example of this phenomenon through the report by Salomon Brothers Inc., which reports the significant appreciation of old masters over the year, the highest return of any of its 13 assets tracked. This example expands on the initial statement by illustrating the point with concrete data, thus providing more detail and supporting the claim made in the first sentence.
 Salomon Brothers Inc. , the investment-banking firm , in its annual tally of investment returns , reported that old masters appreciated 51 % in the year ended June 1 , the greatest return of any of 13 assets it tracked . ||| Impressionist and modern paintings , not tracked by Salomon , are ranked even higher at 74 % by Sotheby 's .|||Comparison|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Salomon Brothers Inc. reported a significant increase in old masters, ranking them the highest of any of 13 investments tracked. The second sentence provides additional information about other art collections, noting that modern and modern paintings were also ranked even higher by Sotheby's. This additional detail expands on the initial report by giving more context about another type of art collection within the same context (investment returns) and providing a comparison with another category (modern and modern art).

The second sentence discusses the inclusion of percentages that do not account for the many paintings that go unappealing at auction. These two sentences form a comparison because they contrast Salomon's data with the non-participation of the paintings. By mentioning the non-participation of the paintings, the text implicitly compares the fact that the figures do not include the many paintings going unavoidable.
 The percentages omit from consideration the many paintings that go begging at auction . ||| Art indexes track winners , not losers .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that the percentages do not include many paintings that go for auction. The second sentence explains that art indexes track winners rather than losers. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the lack of consideration for the many paintings mentioned in the first sentence is contingent upon the fact that art indexes do not consider the many paintings that go for auction. The second sentence provides context for why the percentages do not include paintings that go for auction, suggesting that the fact that many paintings go for auction is a factor that influences the percentages do not include them.
 Also , at any of Sotheby 's auctions of old masters , roughly one-third to one-fifth of what is offered does n't sell at any price . ||| It 's not that there are n't any bids , but the bids do n't meet the minimum `` reserve '' prices set by the sellers .|||Contingency|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that approximately one-third to one-half of what is offered at Sotheby's old master auctions does not sell at any price. The second sentence explains the reason for this lack of sales: the bids don't meet the minimum reserve prices set by the sellers. The second sentence expands on the first by providing additional information that supports the claim made in the first sentence. It further explains the situation that led to the reduced sale prices, reinforcing the point made in the first sentence.

 They went up 51 % last year , and they 'll do it again this year ||| `` They were a sleeper .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that the subject experienced significant growth and the same percentage of sales for the current year. The second sentence states that they were a "sucker," suggesting a positive outlook or performance.

 `` They were a sleeper . ||| Everybody was out buying Monets . ''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that "They were a snob," indicating that there was a strong demand for Monettas.

The second sentence explains a consequence of this situation: if there is natural appreciation for art, they end up with 50% of their art work. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that the situation described in the second sentence (sharking of your jewelry) is contingent upon the situation described in the first sentence (the pressure to sell items too quickly). The second sentence explains a consequence or result of the situation described in the first sentence.
 But quick turnover in artwork is `` like pawning your jewelry -- you end up with 50 % . ||| People hold out and try to get a bargain . ''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence compares quick turnover in artwork to pawning 50% of a piece of jewelry. The second sentence explains what happens as a result of this comparison: people remain interested and try to find a bargain. The second sentence expands on the first by providing additional information about the outcome of the comparison mentioned in the first sentence. It explains what happens as a result of the comparison, thus forming an expansion relationship.

The second sentence introduces Sotheby's, indicating that they are both "wooing both sides," suggesting they are both involved in a similar situation. The comparison relationship is evident because the second sentence contrasts the typical role of an auction house with Sotheby's, highlighting how they are both involved in a similar situation.
 I ca n't see why there would be a conflict of interest ||| `` Estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions , and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be . ''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence expresses a lack of discernible conflict of interest. The second sentence provides information about estimates being based on previous works sold at auction and current market conditions, noting they are not affected by the potential buyer's knowledge.

The second sentence provides additional information about the status of the company, specifically that it will not sign any new contracts with deliveries starting before 2000. This additional detail expands on the initial statement about the company losing its position, explaining the reason behind the decision. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds more context and detail to the situation described in the first sentence.

The second sentence provides information about Hydro-Quebec having some "customers in mind" for the power delivery to Maine. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the non-signing of new contracts (first sentence) is contingent upon Hydro-Quebec having some "customers in mind" for the power delivery (second sentence). Hydro-Quebec's decision not to sign any new contracts is influenced by Hydro-Quebec's already acquiring some customers.
 He said Hydro-Quebec already has some `` customers in mind '' for the power that was to be delivered to Maine . ||| `` Nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that Hydro-Quebec was the lowest-cost , most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers ' energy needs through the year 2020 , '' said Central Maine senior vice president Donald F.

The second sentence explains the consequence of this situation: the traders had no choice but to sell at current prices, often at a significant loss. The contingency relationship is evident because the traders' actions (buying back the contracts) were contingent upon the conditions set forth in the first sentence (the traders' forced action). The situation described in the second sentence is a direct result of the conditions set in the first sentence.
 that , unlike the futures market , the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade ||| that they would n't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining Friday afternoon|||Expansion|||Comparison|||The first sentence explains the unique structure of the options exchange, comparing it to the futures market, where it opens in a rotational manner for each series to trade. The second sentence discusses the difficulty in making this rotation with the time remaining on Friday afternoon. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the unique feature of the options exchange with the inability to make a specific rotation with the limited time remaining on Friday.

''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that Steve and his firm were still worth a lot of money. The second sentence describes a decision to form a credit support package.

The second sentence provides a specific example of this general statement through the actions of the IRS's IRS office in San Jose three years ago, where employees paid the bill for on-site massage. This instance serves to expand on the initial statement by illustrating how one particular organization (the IRS) has faced difficulties with office massage, thereby providing more detail and supporting the original statement.

 his only beef was that the massages were being given in a company conference room ; ||| the department 's supervised health facility would have been fine|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence states that the only complaint was regarding massages being given in a company conference room. The second sentence discusses the department's supervision facility, suggesting it would be fine. The comparison relationship is evident because the second sentence contrasts the situation described in the first sentence with the suggestion that the facility would be fine, suggesting that the facility's supervision is better than the massages being given in a conference room.

The second sentence describes a specific action taken by Quadrant, which was switching to a backup system until the problems were corrected. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the action taken by Quadrant (turning to a backup system) is contingent upon the cause of the software changes (replacing the system). The decision to switch to a backup system is a direct response to the potential problems, thus establishing a contingent relationship between the two sentences.
 `` Today of all days , '' . ||| `` The eyes of the world were watching us .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that there were significant events happening today, specifically a day where the world was watching us.

 he agreed to strike Mr. Alexander above the belt ||| Ms. Parks and her mother indicated they want to `` catch him unawares from behind|||Comparison|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Mr. Alexander agreed to strike Mr. Alexander above the belt. The second sentence provides additional context about the agreement by mentioning that Ms. Parks and her mother want to catch Mr. Alexander unaware from behind. This additional information expands on the initial statement about the agreement, explaining what the intention to do (catching Mr. Alexander unaware) is. Therefore, the second sentence expands on the first by giving more detail about the specific action being taken.
 Ms. Parks and her mother indicated they want to `` catch him unawares from behind ||| Mr. Alexander , for his part , insisted that the punchers ca n't assign their pummeling rights to anyone else , ca n't use a blunt instrument and ca n't take a running start .|||Expansion|||Comparison|||The first sentence indicates that Ms. Parks and her mother want to catch someone unawful from behind.

The sequence of events—market swaying near the closing price, movement on the index, and then the market's behavior—establishes the temporal connection between the two sentences.
 Traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart ||| You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence describes traders making bids and offers within five feet from each other, indicating they are close to each other. The second sentence describes the potential outcome of this closeness: buying at the bid and selling at the offer.

The second sentence states that he still wants AMR. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because Mr. Trump's decision to step back and wait for the dust to settle is contingent upon his desire for AMR. His action (stepping back and waiting) is influenced by his desire for AMR (the same thing as the dust). His desire for AMR is a direct result of his ongoing efforts to maintain his position and wait for the dust to settle.

The second sentence provides information about Citibank and Chase's commitments and their confidence in raising another $4.2 billion. The temporal relationship is evident because the events are sequenced in time: the first UAL deal unraveled, and then Citibank and Chase's commitments and confidence were mentioned.

The second sentence discusses the potential impact of specialists' actions on stock prices, suggesting they cannot prevent a major crack in prices alone. The comparison lies in contrasting the expected outcome of specialists staying (despite criticisms) with the actual outcome (a major crack in stock prices). This contrast highlights the difference in the expected outcomes for the specialists in terms of their capital positions.
 Of course , specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices . ||| Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that specialists' actions cannot prevent a major crack in stock prices. The second sentence provides a specific example of this situation through the closure and opening of stock trading in some stocks early and late due to sell orders.

The second sentence explains that many employers are moving to southern countries like Spain and Italy, where wages are low and unions weak.

In other words, the negative effects of increased funding are a consequence of the economic conditions described in the first sentence.
 More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy ; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies . ||| Is this what the home builders want ?|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines the negative outcomes of increased funding for HUD, including economic destabilization and economic damage.

The second sentence explains that despite the union-bidders' efforts to secure less cash, there is a growing fear among arbitragers that the era of high-risk takeovers is ending. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the context that the events (the events on Friday and Saturday) are contingent upon the fear mentioned in the first sentence. The crashing of the buy-out and the lack of cash-related offers are a direct result of the fear mentioned.
 Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses . ||| UAL , , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that deal stocks led the market down and they absorb the most losses. The second sentence provides specific details about one such deal: UAL, which is a deal aggregator, experienced a decline in price from its previous close on Monday. This detail expands on the general statement in the first sentence by giving a concrete example of a deal that benefited from the market downturn. Therefore, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first sentence.
 UAL , , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close . ||| AMR opened Monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20 % from Thursday 's close .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence provides information about UAL's stock performance on Monday, noting a decrease in value compared to the previous day. The second sentence details another stock, AMR, also experiencing a decline, but at a different price, a nearly 20% decrease from the previous day. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence broadens the context by providing additional information about another stock's performance during the same period, complementing the information about UAL's stock performance.
 UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close . AMR opened Monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20 % from Thursday 's close . ||| Both took further hits yesterday .|||Expansion|||Temporal|||The first sentence states that UAL's stock price dropped significantly on Monday, down about 20% from Thursday's close. The second sentence mentions that both UAL and AMR opened lower on Monday, down nearly 20% from Thursday's close. The temporal relationship is evident because the events in the second sentence (earnings on Monday and then further declines) occurred after the events in the first sentence (stock price movement on Monday). The sequence of events is clearly defined by the timing of the stock price changes.
 UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close . AMR opened Monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20 % from Thursday 's close . Both took further hits yesterday . Hilton lost 20 % on Friday ||| Paramount lost almost 11 %|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that UAL experienced a decline in its stock price on Monday, down about 20% from Thursday's close. The second sentence provides additional information about the stock market movement by mentioning that both companies experienced further declines on Friday. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence broadens the scope of the financial market's movements beyond just UAL and AMRA to include UAL and Paramount.
 A careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured , the target 's stock price was not affected on Friday . ||| The multibillion-dollar prospects , , were where the damage was concentrated .|||Comparison|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that when deal financing has been secured, the target's stock price was not affected on Friday. The second sentence explains that the significant impact on the target's stock price was due to the speculative prospects. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the lack of impact on the target's stock price (first sentence) is contingent upon the speculative aspects of the deal financing (second sentence). In other words, the focus on the speculative prospects led to the stock price not being affected by the deal price.
 The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday 's dramatic march for several weeks . ||| The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers , such as Resorts International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that the market for junk bonds has been preparing for a significant event (a dramatic march).The second sentence explains the impact of recent financial difficulties on the market for high-yield securities, specifically mentioning the financial difficulties of several high-risk takeovers. The contingency relationship is established because the financial difficulties mentioned in the second sentence (the growing difficulties of recent takeovers) have led to the market being clouded over, indicating that the market's condition is contingent upon the events described in the first sentence.
 The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers , such as Resorts International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities . ||| Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring .|||Temporal|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that the financial difficulties of recent high-risk restructurings or takeovers have negatively affected the market for high-yield securities. The second sentence describes actions taken by investors, specifically ignoring junk bonds and forcing Ramada to postpone its junk-bond sale and restructuring. The contingency relationship is evident because the investors' actions (ignoring junk bonds and postponing restructuring) are contingent upon the financial difficulties mentioned in the first sentence. The financial difficulties are a direct result of the financial difficulties faced by the market.
 If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for policy makers ? ||| After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence discusses the finding that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused a negative impact on financial policymakers. The second sentence discusses a potential outcome for policymakers if the stock market reacts negatively to the collapse of the UAL deal. The contingency relationship is established because the potential impact on policymakers (second sentence) is contingent upon the market's reaction to the collapse of the UAL deal (first sentence). The potential consequences for policymakers depend on the outcome of the concerns found.
 After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators . ||| Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington 's bashing of Wall Street ?|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence outlines a scenario where the stock market's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might validate regulators' anti-bond direction. The second sentence questions whether private markets are actually recognizing Washington's actions against Wall Street. The contingency relationship is established because the question in the second sentence is contingent upon the context provided in the first sentence: the potential validation of Washington's actions by private markets is based on the expectation that the market's response might validate regulators' intentions.
 that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior ||| The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that Wall Street and the private markets are capable of imposing appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior. The second sentence explains a reason for this capability: the nation's interests are better served if private interests of bankers and investors are the primary judge of the investment quality of various leveraged restructuring deals and deals. The second sentence expands on the idea presented in the first by providing a specific context (public interests and investors) for why Wall Street and the private markets are capable of imposing sanctions.
 The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings . ||| The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence outlines a principle: the nation's economic interests are better served if private interests are the sole judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings. The second sentence discusses recent difficulties in junk-bond markets and the shortage of bank capital for recent deals, which underscores the importance of allowing free markets to operate. The expansion relationship is evident because the second sentence builds upon the principle introduced in the first sentence by providing additional context about the economic challenges faced in the market. It expands on the implications of the principle introduced in the first sentence.
 but they rode the tiger up all year . ||| Not surprisingly , he sometimes bites .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that there was a strong support for the bull, which was fueled by the bull. The second sentence introduces a consequence of this support: the bull sometimes bites. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the occurrence of the bull's bite is contingent upon the bull's actions (running the bull up). The second event (the bull's bite) is a consequence of the first (the bull riding up), illustrating a contingent relationship.
 while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily ||| If you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence indicates that the managers of prospective targets sat gleefully and expressed excitement. The second sentence discusses the potential benefits of a timely and effective relief from the marketplace if one aligns with the vested managers. The comparison lies in contrasting the enthusiasm and enthusiasm of the vested managers with the potential benefits of a timely and effective relief from the marketplace. This contrast highlights the difference in the benefits of a timely and effective response from the marketplace compared to the immediate intervention of the vested managers.
 If you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington . ||| If you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators , .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines a condition under which one aligns with the leveraged managers: they must concede that swift and effective relief from takeover excesses is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington. The second sentence presents a condition under which one supports arbitragers and raiders, suggesting a similar level of risk to being protected from regulators. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the potential benefits of supporting arbitragers and raiders with the potential risks faced by private investors and raiders, highlighting the difference in risk based on the leveraged managers and the market.
 , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm . ||| Any such attempt to distinguish `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , , is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that actual legislation would likely have significant negative effects. The second sentence explains one reason for this potential negative impact: any attempt to distinguish good debt from bad debt or draw a line at a specific industry would likely reduce the benefits for equity markets and economic efficiency. Thus, the second sentence provides a contingent reason for the expected negative effects mentioned in the first sentence, establishing a contingent relationship.
 Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning , with the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising 618.69 points to close the morning session at 35087.38 . ||| The index slid 647.33 points , or 1.8 % , on Monday .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence states that Tokyo share prices rebounded early morning, with the Nikkei index increasing by 618.69 points to close at 357.38. The second sentence provides information about the index's movement on Monday, noting a 1.8% drop. The comparison relationship is evident as the text contrasts the recovery in Tokyo share prices with the decline in the index on Monday. This contrast highlights the difference in the extent of the recovery in the market over the two days.
 In the first 25 minutes of Tuesday 's trading the Nikkei index soared 664.83 points , to 35133.83 . ||| By 10 a.m. Tokyo time , the index was up 435.11 points , to 34903.80 as investors hailed New York 's overnight rally .|||Expansion|||Temporal|||The first sentence states that the Nikkei index increased by 664.83 points in the first 25 minutes of trading on Tuesday. The second sentence provides more specific information about the index's movement by mentioning that by 10 a.m. PT, it increased by 411 points to reach 35308.80, and investors praised New York's overnight rally. The second sentence expands on the first by giving concrete numbers and context for the increase mentioned, hence the expansion relationship.
 Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe , particularly in Frankfurt , although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in New York . ||| Other Asian and Pacific markets had sharper losses than Tokyo , but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash .|||Temporal|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that shares closed sharply lower in Frankfurt and some other markets, but recovered some ground after gains in New York City. The second sentence provides additional information about the situation in other Asian and Pacific markets, noting that while Tokyo experienced a sharper loss, the selling wave did not cause a significant market crash. This additional detail expands on the initial statement about the market downturn, giving more context and specifics about the market conditions in these markets. Therefore, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first one.
 as our policy now is to wait and see ||| `` We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states the policy of waiting and seeing what happens. The second sentence provides more specific details about what "that" means in this context: trading moves through Europe and New York. The second sentence expands on the first by giving more information about the nature of the "wait and see" policy mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
 At the close , the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at 34468.69 , down 647.33 points , or 1.8 % . ||| The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank 45.66 , or 1.7 % , to 2600.88 .|||Temporal|||Expansion|||The first sentence provides information about the Nikkei index's performance at the close. The second sentence details the decline of the wider Tokyo Stock Price Index. These two sentences form a comparison relationship because they present the changes in stock prices for different indexes (Nikokei and Tokyo Stock Price). The comparison highlights the difference in stock performance between the two indexes over the same period.
 The market opened sharply lower , with the Nikkei average down nearly 600 after 20 minutes . ||| A midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session|||Temporal|||Temporal|||The first sentence states that the market started very low initially, with the Nikkei average decreasing nearly 600 after 20 minutes. The second sentence describes a midmorning rebound that returned the market to its normal state and eventually gained about 200 at the end of the morning session. The temporal relationship is evident because the second event (return to normal) happened after the first event (the market starting very low). This sequence of events establishes the temporal connection between the two sentences.
 The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year . ||| The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell 100.96 , or 2.7 % , to 3655.40 .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that smaller stocks in the Tokyo market's second section experienced the largest decline of the year. The second sentence provides specific details about the decline in the Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section, indicating that it fell by a specific percentage. This detailed information expands on the initial statement about the biggest decline, offering concrete evidence of the decline. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
 On Oct. 16 , 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped 4.6 % , and Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4 % drop . ||| This time , Wall Street 's plunge of 6.9 % Friday was followed by yesterday 's 1.8 % loss in Tokyo .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence provides information about the declines in the New York market and Tokyo on October 16, 1987, following the Black Monday crash. The second sentence introduces a different event, the Wall Street plunge on Friday and the subsequent decline in Tokyo. The comparison relationship is evident as the text contrasts the events of the New York market drop with the decline in Tokyo, highlighting the difference in market movements over time.
 Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders ||| `` For us institutional investors , the chance for buying has come . ''|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that there is a need for the right time to place buy orders. The second sentence provides a reason for this need: for institutional investors, the opportunity for buying has arrived. The need for buy orders (first sentence) is contingent upon the timing of the purchase, indicating that the opportunity for institutional investors is now imminent (second sentence). Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the action taken by the investor (putting orders) depends on the condition (the timing being right).
 Isao Ushikubo , general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust & Banking Co. , also was optimistic . ||| He described Friday 's plunge in the U.S. as a `` fleeting '' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Isotopo Ishizuku, the general manager of the investment research department at Tokyo Trust & Banking Co., expressed optimism. The second sentence expands on this optimism by explaining why he was optimistic: he described the recent drop in the U.S. market as a "familiar event" due to excessive merger and acquisition activity. This additional information deepens our understanding of the positive outlook mentioned in the first sentence, hence the expansion relationship.
 , this is the best time to buy , ||| `` Those shares which had posted gains on M&A speculation were dashed with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned , there is n't much impact . ''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that it is the best time to buy, suggesting that there are opportunities available for buying.The second sentence explains a reason for this decision: shares that had posted gains from M&A speculation were slashed with cold water, but there isn't much impact on major stocks. The second sentence provides a reason or context for the decision mentioned in the first sentence, indicating that the best time to buy is contingent upon the positive outcomes of M&A speculation.
 Other fund managers were similarly sanguine . ||| `` We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , '' said Masato Murakami , chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at Yasuda Trust & Banking Co .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that other fund managers were generally glimmery, suggesting a positive outlook or attitude. The second sentence provides more detail on this sentiment through a quote from Satoshi Murayama, who specifically states that he does not plan to adjust his asset allocation in foreign equity. This quote expands on the initial statement by giving a specific example of the positive outlook mentioned, thus deepening our understanding of the initial statement.
 We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities ||| Friday 's Wall Street decline was `` well within the range of volatility '' that Yasuda Trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that there are no plans to adjust the asset allocation in foreign equity. The second sentence provides context for this statement by stating that the Wall Street decline on Friday was well within the range of volatility that Nadir Trust plans to forecast its overseas investment strategy. This information expands on the initial statement by explaining the nature of the current plan (well within the range of volatility) and explaining its purpose (to chart its overseas investment strategy). Thus, the second sentence expands on the first by providing additional details about the current plan.

 Major indexes declined more than 8 % in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5 % in Hong Kong . ||| Bangkok , Manila , Seoul , Taipei and Jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses .|||Expansion|||Comparison|||The first sentence states that major indexes declined by over 8% in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5% in Hong Kong. The second sentence mentions that Bangkok, Seoul, and Jakarta experienced slightly smaller losses. These sentences establish a comparison by contrasting the extent of decline between major indexes in different countries (Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand, and Hong Kong). This contrast highlights the difference in market performance between the two countries.

''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the reason for something is pure psychology. The second sentence provides additional context by explaining why it's not geared to leveraged buyouts in the region and how Asian economies generally perform well, suggesting that they continue to follow the lead of America.

The second sentence provides a potential outcome if New York does not collapse, which is possibly another 5% on the downside. The contingency relationship is established because the potential negative outcome (maybe another 5% on the downside) is contingent upon New York not collapsing. If New York does not collapse, the speaker believes that the situation in New York is near close, leading to a possible negative outcome for the speaker.
 London 's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of 2163.4 , down 70.5 , or 3.2 % . ||| At its low , shortly before Wall Street opened , it was off more than 130 points .|||Comparison|||Expansion|||The first sentence provides information about the performance of London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, noting its decline and the extent of its decline.

The second sentence provides specific details about the extent of the drop: a 203.56 points decline in the German Stock Index, which is described as the largest drop ever, and the duration of the decline. This detail expands upon the initial statement about the price drop, offering concrete evidence of the drop.

 Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side , everything loose would end up in California . ||| We 've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California 's vitality , but maybe the state 's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place .|||Comparison|||Contingency|||The first sentence presents a quote made by Frank Lloyd Wright, suggesting that if one had turned the world on its side, everything would end up in California. The second sentence expands on this idea by suggesting a possible reason for the state's decline: the lilac divisions that made California a significant place. This suggests that the lilac divisions, which were previously dominant in California, may have contributed to the state becoming more significant, thereby expanding on the initial statement.
 but maybe the state 's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place . ||| What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general ?|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence suggests there's a possibility that the state's labyrinthine factions are causing a disarray in a significant place. The second sentence introduces a specific proposal by the state's attorney general, which is aimed at saving the earth. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the proposal by the governor (second sentence) is presented as a response to the potential disarray caused by the labyrinthine factions (first sentence). The proposal is contingent upon the disarray, suggesting a possible cause-and-effect relationship.
 The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of Conservation Voters , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment . ||| Interestingly , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines the nature of the initiative, mentioning its base of supporters, including notable organizations like the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Cancer Coalition, and the Citizens for a Better Environment. The second sentence introduces the Environmental Defense Fund, a non-governmental organization, and notes that it is not involved in this particular issue. The comparison relationship is established by contrasting the broader context of the initiative with the absence of specific organizations involved in its implementation. This contrast highlights the difference in involvement between the two groups in the initiative.
 Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed . ||| The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that do n't meet the initiative 's standards .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that not only Californians would be fined, but all Americans would suffer if the thing passed. The second sentence provides specific details about the issue: the initiative prohibits the sale of crops that do not meet the initiative's standards in California. This detail expands on the initial statement by specifying what the issue entails (not meeting certain standards) and what it does (sale bans). Therefore, the second sentence expands on the information presented in the first sentence.
 The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that do n't meet the initiative 's standards . ||| Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence outlines a restriction placed on the sale of certain crops that do not meet California's standards. The second sentence describes a consequence of this restriction: Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers needing to adjust or sell their crops to avoid the California market. Thus, the need for Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers to adapt or sell their crops is contingent upon the imposed restrictions mentioned in the first sentence. The relationship is one of contingency, where the action taken (adapting or selling crops) depends on the condition (not meeting California's standards).
 As usual the green lobby 's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality . ||| Consider the greenhouse-effect provision .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the green lobby's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality. The second sentence provides a specific example of this disconnect: the greenhouse-effect provision. This example expands on the initial statement by illustrating how the green lobby's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality, thus providing more detail and supporting the original statement.
 Consider the greenhouse-effect provision . ||| The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence introduces the greenhouse-effect provision as a consideration. The second sentence provides more detail about what this proposal entails, specifically mentioning the requirement for a 40% reduction in carbon dioxide. Thus, the second sentence expands on the information provided in the first sentence by giving specifics about the greenhouse-effect provision.
 The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % . ||| Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence introduces the proposed initiative and its mandate for a reduction of 40% carbon dioxide. The second sentence discusses the uncertainty around whether reductions in one state could significantly impact the global issue, referred to as a global problem. The comparison lies in contrasting the proposed reduction of 40% with the uncertainty of its global impact, highlighting the disparity between the proposed reduction and the potential impact on global issues.
 The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp . ||| He 's running for governor .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence introduces the key point of the state Attorney General's ambition of state Attorney General John Van De Kamp. The second sentence provides more specific information about what this ambition is: he is running for governor. The second sentence expands on the first by giving more detail about the nature of the governor's ambition mentioned in the first sentence. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence adds more specific information to the initial statement.
 and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 ||| That 's also the day of the gubernatorial election .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that an initiative was crafted into a single ballot for election on November 6, 1990. The second sentence provides additional context by mentioning that this date is the same day the governor's election. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the second sentence provides information that explains the action described in the first sentence (creating the initiative). The creation of the initiative is contingent upon the election day being the same day as the governor's election.
 And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits . ||| He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that something allows Mr. Van der Kamp to bypass campaign spending limits. The second sentence provides more specific information about how this is achieved: Mr. Van der Kamp can spend the legal maximum for his campaign. The second sentence expands on the first by giving concrete steps that illustrate the method Mr. Van der Kamp uses to circumvent campaign spending limits. Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
 He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ||| all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative is gravy|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that the individual can spend the legal maximum for his campaign. The second sentence provides additional information about the financial aspects of his campaign, specifically mentioning that all spending for the Van de Kamp initiative is considered "gray." This additional detail expands on the context of the legal maximum mentioned in the first sentence, explaining that the expenditure for his campaign is not limited to just one aspect but extends to other aspects of the campaign. Thus, the second sentence expands the information provided in the first one by giving more context about the financial aspects of his campaign.
 He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative on which there are no limits is gravy . ||| This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback .|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence outlines the legal maximum allowed for the individual's campaign, which is $50,000.

 These rate indications are n't directly comparable ||| lending practices vary widely by location|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that rate indications are not directly comparable. The second sentence explains one reason for this lack of comparability: lending practices vary widely by location.

General Assembly declared it the `` sole , authentic representative '' of Namibia 's people in|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence suggests that Mr. Stanley may have acted in a way that is out of line with the consensus of world intellectuals who view the Namibian guerrillas as the victims of oppression by South Africa. The second sentence provides context for why this might be the case: SWP has received favorable Western media treatment since the U.N. General Assembly declared SWP as the authentic representative of Namibia's people. This recognition by the U.N. General Assembly is contingent upon Mr. Stanley's actions and the perceptions he shares. The relationship between the two sentences is one of contingency, where the second sentence provides a reason or justification for the claim made in the first sentence.

 For one thing , last Friday , precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late-in-the-day nose dive , so it could n't react to it . ||| Back on Friday , Oct. 16 , l987 , the stock market declined during the day , and gold prices surged as the stock market fell .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence explains that precious metals markets closed before the stock market's late-day decline on a specific day, preventing it from reacting to the market. The second sentence provides a similar situation on a different day (October 16) when the stock market declined during the day and gold prices rose as the stock market declined.

The second sentence describes the subsequent increase in the October 1987 contract, increasing to as high as $451.50, but with a gain of almost $20 on top of the Friday advances. The temporal relationship is evident because the second event (the increase in the contract) happened after the first event (the rise in the contract).

 Yesterday 's October gain of $ 4 was miniscule compared with that . ||| the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that yesterday's October gain of $4 was small relative to what was mentioned in the first sentence. The second sentence explains that the gold market had good price-supporting technical factors that would have allowed prices to rise, regardless of the stock market. The contingency relationship is established because the small gain of $4 (first sentence) is contingent upon the availability of good technical factors (second sentence). In other words, the price-supporting factors would have enabled prices to rise without the stock market, making the second sentence contingent upon the first.
 the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market ||| `` What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened , ''|||Contingency|||Comparison|||The first sentence outlines the conditions under which the gold market had good price-supporting technical factors, specifically mentioning the stock market's influence on prices. The second sentence discusses the effect of the stock market's actions, specifically mentioning that it caused the price rise to occur earlier than anticipated.

The second sentence predicts that gold's gains will continue and rise further. The contingency relationship is established because the continuation and rise of gold's gains (second sentence) are contingent upon the initial event of the stock market's actions (first sentence). The expectation of gold's continued gains is dependent on the occurrence of the stock market's actions.
 There 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further ||| He expects a drop in interest rates , which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising .|||Contingency|||Expansion|||The first sentence predicts that gold will continue to gain and increase further.

The second sentence provides context for this effect by stating that futures prices had been rising due to expectations of strong global oil demand. The comparison lies in contrasting the current state of the petroleum pits (dilution due to stock market drops) with the previous state (upturn in futures prices). This contrast highlights the difference in the current situation versus the previous state.
 Until yesterday , futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong . ||| The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that futures prices were rising due to expectations of strong global oil demand.

''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that Treasury bonds were off, which was an encouraging sign. The second sentence explains what this meant by "not running to the safety of bonds," suggesting that people were not using bonds. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that the offending behavior of Treasury bonds (not running to the safety of bonds) is contingent upon the fact that Treasury bonds were off, as mentioned in the first sentence.

 Meanwhile , a test of the stock market 's rally came at about 2 p.m. , with the Dow at 2600 , up 31 points on the day . ||| bargain hunting had explained the Dow 's strength up to that point and that many market professionals were anticipating a drop in the Dow|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that the stock market's rally was tested at a specific point in time, with the Dow increasing by 31 points on the day. The second sentence explains that market analysts had predicted the decline in the Dow's strength up until that point and were predicting a drop in the Dow. The contingency relationship is established because the prediction of a drop in the Dow (second sentence) is contingent upon the test of the market's rally (first sentence). The prediction of a drop in the Dow's strength is directly related to the test of the market's rally.
 Instead , the rally only paused for about 25 minutes and then steamed forward as institutions resumed buying . ||| The market closed minutes after reaching its high for the day of|||Temporal|||Temporal|||The first sentence describes the slow start of a rally, which then moved forward with institutions resuming buying. The second sentence mentions the closing price of the market, which was just after reaching its highest point for the day.

This sequence of events establishes the temporal connection between the two sentences.

The second sentence provides a specific example of this general sentiment through the words of James Norman, the mayor of Avaa, who praised the market's performance but also expressed anxiety about it. This quote expands on the general sentiment mentioned in the first sentence by offering a concrete instance of someone who shares the same sentiment, thus providing additional detail and support for the general statement made earlier.

The second sentence explains that the court did not anticipate weather or protests blocking the flyover. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the court's decision (denying the lawsuit) is contingent upon the lack of expectation of weather or protests blocking the flyover. The decision not to delay the flight is a direct response to the legal situation.
 but did n't show any real signs of resuming full diplomatic ties . ||| The Egyptian president said he would visit Libya today to resume the talks .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence indicates that there were no signs of resuming full diplomatic relations. The second sentence describes an action taken by the Egyptian president, who plans to visit Libya to resume talks.

The second sentence provides additional context by mentioning that senior administration officials were frustrated with Webster's low-profile actions during the coup and wanted him replaced.

The second sentence states that he did not provide additional details on other asset sales being considered. The comparison relationship is evident because the second sentence contrasts the information provided in the first sentence with what Mr. Farley did not provide (information about other asset sales). This contrast highlights the lack of detail about the potential impact of the asset sales on the total value of the two entities.
 The moves also could erase shareholders ' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil . ||| `` It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past , ''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that certain moves could diminish shareholders' perception of Blue Arrow as a troubled company. The second sentence explains how they do this: by reinforcing the notion that Blue Arrow is a distant past. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the second sentence describes an action (informing shareholders of Blue Arrow's status as a distant company) that is contingent upon the situation described in the first sentence (the potential negative impact of the moves). The action is a direct response to the potential negative perception, thus establishing a contingent relationship.
 In a widely publicized boardroom coup , Mr. Fromstein ousted Antony Berry as Blue Arrow chief executive in January , . ||| Mr. Fromstein solidified his control in April by taking over from Mr. Berry as chairman .|||Temporal|||Temporal|||The first sentence states that Mr. Stoltzman resigned from his position as Blue Arrow chief executive in January after being removed by A.T. Berry. The second sentence mentions that Mr. Stoltzman strengthened his control in April by taking over as chairman in April. The temporal relationship is evident because the events are sequenced in time: Mr. Stoltzman's resignation came before his continued control in April. This sequence of events—resignation precedes his new position—establishes a temporal connection between the two sentences.
 different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies ||| Under British rules , Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase . As a U.S.-based company , Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that different accounting standards result in higher reported earnings for British companies. The second sentence explains how Blue Arrow, a British-based company, managed to avoid the $1.5 billion in goodwill from the purchase, thereby reducing the impact on reported earnings. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that Blue Arrow's ability to write off the goodwill at once (as described in the first sentence) is contingent upon its financial impact on reported earnings (as explained in the second sentence). The second sentence describes a scenario where Blue Arrow's financial situation depends on the specific financial implications of the purchase.
 Under British rules , Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase . ||| As a U.S.-based company , Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence explains that under British rules, Blue Arrow was able to write off $1.15 billion in good will from the purchase. The second sentence discusses Blue Arrow's situation with a U.S.-based company, where they would need to amortize the good will over many years, leading to continued earnings impact. The comparison lies in contrasting Blue Arrow's ability to write off the good will with the financial implications for Blue Arrow, specifically the ongoing earnings impact.
 But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards . ||| `` Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice 's wonderland , ''|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that Blue Arrow, with its shares held in the U.S., makes its earnings reports two ways, using both accounting standards and U.S. accounting standards. The second sentence describes the appearance of Blue Arrow's balance sheets from Alice's paradise. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that the appearance of Blue Arrow's balance sheets (second sentence) is contingent upon the accounting standards (first sentence). The accounting standards are a consequence or result of the two ways Blue Arrow makes its earnings reports, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
 `` Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice 's wonderland , '' ||| The British version shows `` a handful of pounds of net worth '' following the 1987 write-off of good will , while the American version reflects `` $ 1 billion of net worth because almost none of the good will has been written off . ''|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the balance sheets look like they came from Alice's paradise. The second sentence provides specific details about the balance sheets, mentioning the British version and the American version, and mentioning the percentage of net worth after the 1987 write-off due to goodwill. This detailed information expands on the initial claim, offering concrete examples of how the balance sheets look from Alice's paradise, thus providing more context and detail to support the original statement.
 but would n't specify how much . ||| People close to Blue Arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of Manpower 's good will .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence indicates uncertainty about the amount of a write-down, implying uncertainty or lack of clarity. The second sentence introduces a viewpoint from some executives at Blue Arrow who believe the extent of Manpower's good will could be significant. The comparison relationship is established through contrasting the uncertainty expressed in the first sentence with the skepticism from executives who believe the write-down could be significant. This contrast highlights the differing perspectives on the magnitude of the write-down.
 and its profits have dropped . ||| Last year 's earnings of $ 1.3 million , including $ 815,000 from a restructuring gain , were far below the year-earlier $ 8.4 million .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the company's profits have dropped. The second sentence provides specific financial information about the decline in earnings last year, including specific figures for the restructuring gain and the earnings from the previous year. This detailed financial information expands upon the initial statement about the decline in profits, offering concrete evidence of the decline. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence provides additional details to support the claim made in the first sentence.
 Besides spurring Barry Wright 's sales , which were $ 201.7 million in 1988 , Mr. Sim must pare its costs and product line . ||| The question is how long it 's going to take Barry Wright to make a contribution|||Contingency|||Contingency|||The first sentence outlines the actions taken by Mr. Sims to boost Barry Wright's sales, including boosting sales and cutting costs. The second sentence questions whether it will take long for Barry Wright to make a contribution. The contingency relationship is established because the question about whether Barry Wright can make a contribution (second sentence) is contingent upon the actions mentioned in the first sentence. The need to reduce costs is a direct response to the situation described.
 The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. Sim . ||| The Butler , Wis. , manufacturer went public at $ 15.75 a share in August 1987 , and Mr. Sim 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992 .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the answer will help determine whether Advanced can meet its ambitious goals set by Mr. Sim.

The second sentence provides additional information about how strong earnings growth helped achieve this goal, specifically mentioning that the price was achieved much earlier in August 1988. This additional detail expands on the initial statement about the goal, explaining when the goal was reached and the timing of the achievement. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
 Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in August 1988 . ||| The stock has since softened , .|||Comparison|||Comparison|||The first sentence states that strong earnings growth helped achieve a certain price in August 1988. The second sentence mentions that the stock has since softened. These two sentences form a comparison by contrasting the positive impact of strong earnings growth with the negative impact on the stock's performance. The comparison highlights the difference in the stock's performance over time.
 In Barry Wright , Mr. Sim sees a situation `` very similar '' to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985 . ||| Applied , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that Mr. Sims sees a similar situation in Barry Wright, similar to what he faced when he joined Advanced in 1985. The second sentence provides additional context about the situation by describing the context and circumstances surrounding his time at Advanced, which was tightly held and managed by its controlling family. This additional information expands on the initial statement about the similarity of the situation, explaining the context and the challenges he faced when he joined the company. Therefore, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first one.
 Applied , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family . ||| While profitable , it `` was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital , ''|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that Applied, a closely held company, was experiencing decline under the leadership of its controlling family. The second sentence provides more detail about the situation: while profitable, the company wasn't growing and wasn't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital. This additional information expands on the initial statement about the company's decline, explaining why it was unable to grow and what factors led to its decline. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
 the new unit 's operations `` fundamentally sound '' that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors ||| With a little patience , these businesses will perform very satisfactorily|||Contingency|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the new unit's operations are fundamentally sound and Johnson has been successful in entering markets that haven't been interested larger competitors. The second sentence suggests that with a little patience, these businesses will perform very well. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the success of Johnson's moves (first sentence) is contingent upon the need for patience (second sentence). In other words, the success of Johnson's moves depends on the patience provided by the new unit's operations.
 it will be easier to turn Barry Wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat ||| When he came to Applied , `` I did n't have the power to execute as I do today , ''|||Comparison|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that Barry Wright is now in the driver's seat, suggesting a positive position for him.The second sentence explains a situation he faced when he came to Aerospace, where he didn't have the power to execute effectively. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that the improved position of Barry Wright (being in the driver's seat) is contingent upon his new position at the company (being in the driver's seat). His new position at Aerospace is a direct result of his new position, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.

 He took the company public in an offering that netted Applied about $ 12.6 million , which helped launch the company 's acquisition program . ||| Sales climbed to an estimated $ 245 million in fiscal 1989 , ended Aug. 31 , from $ 99.9 million in fiscal 1985 .|||Expansion|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the company was sold privately in 1989, resulting in an acquisition program. The second sentence provides additional financial information about the company, specifically mentioning the increase in sales over the fiscal year.

The second sentence discusses Washington's actions leading up to the crisis, including their silence and the potential for confusion with the leverage equation.
