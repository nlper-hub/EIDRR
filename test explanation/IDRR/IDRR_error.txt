The second sentence describes actions taken by investors, specifically ignoring junk bonds and forcing Ramada to postpone its junk-bond sale and restructuring. The contingency relationship is evident because the investors' actions (ignoring junk bonds and postponing restructuring) are contingent upon the financial difficulties mentioned in the first sentence. The financial difficulties are a direct result of the financial difficulties faced by the market.
 that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior ||| The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that Wall Street and the private markets are capable of imposing appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior. The second sentence explains a reason for this capability: the nation's interests are better served if private interests of bankers and investors are the primary judge of the investment quality of various leveraged restructuring deals and deals.

''|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that there is a need for the right time to place buy orders.

The second sentence provides context for this effect by stating that futures prices had been rising due to expectations of strong global oil demand.

This contrast highlights the difference in the current situation versus the previous state.
 Until yesterday , futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong . ||| The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that futures prices were rising due to expectations of strong global oil demand. The second sentence provides additional context by explaining that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter due to strong demand.

The decision to buy sugar is a direct response to the need for sugar and its associated needs.
 Earlier in the session , the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows . ||| A broad rally began when several major processors began buying futures contracts , .|||Comparison|||Temporal|||The first sentence states that the prices of several soybean contracts reached new lows earlier in the session. The second sentence describes a general rally that began after major processors began buying futures contracts. The temporal relationship is evident because the second event (the rally) happened after the first event (the price breaking new lows). The sequence of events is clearly defined by the sequence of events: the price breaking and then the rally starting.
 the restatement will reduce its net for the nine months ended July 31 to $ 2.5 million , or 17 cents a share , from $ 3.7 million , or 26 cents a share ||| Net for the third quarter , restated , is $ 1.6 million , or 10 cents a share .|||Expansion|||Comparison|||The first sentence states that the restatement will reduce the net for the nine months ending July 31 to $2.5 million or 17 cents a share, reducing it to $2.7 million or 26 cents a share. The second sentence provides the net for the third quarter, which was made up of $1.6 million or 10 cents a share. These two sentences form a comparison because they present the net income for different periods (nine months versus three quarters). This comparison helps to understand how the company's net income for the current period is different from the net income for the current quarter.
 In American Stock Exchange composite trading , ISI closed up $ 3.125 at $ 18.625 . ||| In Montreal Exchange trading , Memotec closed unchanged at 10.625 Canadian dollars US$ 9.05 .|||Temporal|||Expansion|||The first sentence provides information about the closing price and increase for IBM in American Stock Exchange composite trading. The second sentence details the closing price and change for Semiconductor in Montreal Exchange trading. These sentences share a common theme of stock price movements in different markets, indicating that both IBM and Semiconductor experienced gains. The relationship is one of expansion because the second sentence broadens the scope of the first by including additional information about another company's stock performance.
 , , it began to turn around . ||| It ended with a gain of 88.12 points .|||Temporal|||Expansion|||The first sentence indicates that something started to turn around. The second sentence provides specific details about the turn: it ended with a gain of 88.12 points. The second sentence expands on the first by giving concrete numbers (the gain of 88.12 points) that illustrate the point made in the first sentence (the turning point). Thus, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion, where the second sentence provides additional information that elaborates on the first.

's Tokyo trading room , some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly , with few orders to process . ||| Clients `` are all staying out '' of the market|||Contingency|||Expansion|||The first sentence describes the situation at Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Tokyo trading room, where about 40 traders and assistants were sat quietly and with little orders to process. The second sentence provides additional information about the situation by stating that customers are "staying out of the market." This additional detail expands on the initial description of the trading environment, explaining that the activity is not limited to the traders and assistants mentioned earlier. Therefore, the second sentence expands the description of the trading environment introduced in the first sentence.
 In London , the view from the trading floor of an American securities firm , Jefferies & Co. , also was troubling . ||| A computer screen displaying 100 blue-chip stocks colors each one red when its price is falling . The screen was a sea of red .|||Contingency|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the view from the trading floor of a American securities firm, Jefferies & Co., was troubling from London. The second sentence provides more detail about what made the view troubling: a computer screen showing 100 blue-chip stocks with each one falling. This additional information expands on the initial statement by specifying what made the view troubling, thus deepening our understanding of the troubling view mentioned in the first sentence.
 The screen was a sea of red . ||| `` I see concern , but I do n't see panic , ''|||Comparison|||Contingency|||The first sentence describes the screen as red, indicating a state of uncertainty or distress. The second sentence provides additional context about the speaker's feelings, specifically mentioning concern but not panic. This additional information expands on the initial description of the screen as red, offering more detail about the speaker's feelings, thus establishing an expansion relationship.
 When trading opened in New York at 9:30 a.m. EDT , stocks fell sharply -- as expected . ||| Futures markets in Chicago had opened at a level suggesting the Dow would fall by about 60 points .|||Temporal|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that when trading opened in New York at 9.30 a.m. EDT, stocks fell sharply, which is an expected trend. The second sentence provides additional context by mentioning that futures markets in Chicago opened at a level of about 60 points, which is a significant drop from the previous day. This additional information expands on the initial statement about stock market declines, providing more detail about the market conditions during that period. Thus, the second sentence expands the information presented in the first one by giving a specific example of market declines in other markets.
 Futures markets in Chicago had opened at a level suggesting the Dow would fall by about 60 points . ||| With sell orders piled up from Friday , about half the stocks in the Dow could n't open on time .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that futures markets in Chicago opened at a level suggesting the Dow would fall by about 60 points. The second sentence explains a consequence of this situation: with sell orders accumulating from Friday, about half of the Dow stocks could not open on time. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the conditional scenario: the accumulating sell orders (second sentence) led to the limited ability of the Dow to open on time (first sentence). The second event (stocks not opening on time) was contingent upon the first (opening at a specific level).
 With sell orders piled up from Friday , about half the stocks in the Dow could n't open on time . ||| By 9:45 , the industrial average had dropped 27 points .|||Temporal|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that due to sell orders from Friday, approximately half of the Dow could not open early on the market. The second sentence provides a specific consequence of this situation: by 9:45 the industrial average dropped 27 points. The drop in the industrial average is contingent upon the broader market conditions described in the first sentence. The market's reaction (dropping 27 points) is a direct result of the market conditions described.
 Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day . ||| `` Rally , rally , rally , '' shouted Shearson 's Andy Rosen .|||Contingency|||Temporal|||The first sentence describes an event where Wall Street rallied to a gain on the day nine minutes later. The second sentence describes the reaction of Aaron Rosenberg's reporter, Andy Rosen, who yells at the same time. The temporal relationship is evident because the reporter's reaction (yelling at Rosenberg) happened after the event described in the first sentence (Wall Street rallying to a gain). The reporter's reaction is a direct result of the event, indicating a sequence of events over time.
 By 10:25 , the Dow had turned up for the day , prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors . ||| Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` Pull your offers '' -- .|||Contingency|||Comparison|||The first sentence describes the situation where the Dow reached a certain point, causing a significant increase in trading activity and causing a wave on trading floors and exchange floors. The second sentence introduces the reaction of Big Board specialists who called for the withdrawal of offers. The comparison relationship is evident as the second sentence contrasts the positive reaction of the trading professionals with the negative reaction of the Big Board specialists. It highlights the difference in reaction from the individual's perspective on the situation.

The second sentence expands on this situation by explaining that many market makers in the S&P 100 index contract had bull positions on Friday and were left frozen when the shutdown occurred. This additional information deepens our understanding of the situation described in the first sentence, hence the expansion relationship.
 Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses . ||| Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning .|||Contingency|||Temporal|||The first sentence indicates that many market makers in the S&P 500 index options contract had bull positions on Friday and were unable to move their positions due to the shutdown. The second sentence describes a specific action taken by clearing firms, which was to advise the Chicago market makers to exit their positions at any cost. This action is contingent upon the situation described in the first sentence, as clearing firms' advice is a direct response to the market makers' situation.
 and a federal appeals court in Washington dismissed a lawsuit by anti-nuclear groups to delay the flight because the plutonium-powered Galileo space probe was aboard . ||| it did n't expect weather or protesters to block the liftoff|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that a federal appeals court dismissed a lawsuit involving anti-nuclear groups and the Galileo space probe due to its status as a space probe. The second sentence explains that the court did not anticipate weather or protests blocking the flyover. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the court's decision (denying the lawsuit) is contingent upon the lack of expectation of weather or protests blocking the flyover. The decision not to delay the flight is a direct response to the legal situation.
 different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies ||| Under British rules , Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase . As a U.S.-based company , Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that different accounting standards result in higher reported earnings for British companies. The second sentence explains how Blue Arrow, a British-based company, managed to avoid the $1.5 billion in goodwill from the purchase, thereby reducing the impact on reported earnings. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that Blue Arrow's ability to write off the goodwill at once (as described in the first sentence) is contingent upon its financial impact on reported earnings (as explained in the second sentence). The second sentence describes a scenario where Blue Arrow's financial situation depends on the specific financial implications of the purchase.
 Applied , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family . ||| While profitable , it `` was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital , ''|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that Applied, a closely held company, was experiencing decline under the leadership of its controlling family. The second sentence provides more detail about the situation: while profitable, the company wasn't growing and wasn't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital. This additional information expands on the initial statement about the company's decline, explaining why it was unable to grow and what factors led to its decline. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of expansion.
 the new unit 's operations `` fundamentally sound '' that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors ||| With a little patience , these businesses will perform very satisfactorily|||Contingency|||Expansion|||The first sentence states that the new unit's operations are fundamentally sound and Johnson has been successful in entering markets that haven't been interested larger competitors. The second sentence suggests that with a little patience, these businesses will perform very well. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because the success of Johnson's moves (first sentence) is contingent upon the need for patience (second sentence). In other words, the success of Johnson's moves depends on the patience provided by the new unit's operations.
 it will be easier to turn Barry Wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat ||| When he came to Applied , `` I did n't have the power to execute as I do today , ''|||Comparison|||Contingency|||The first sentence indicates that Barry Wright is now in the driver's seat, suggesting a positive position for him.The second sentence explains a situation he faced when he came to Aerospace, where he didn't have the power to execute effectively. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the fact that the improved position of Barry Wright (being in the driver's seat) is contingent upon his new position at the company (being in the driver's seat). His new position at Aerospace is a direct result of his new position, making the relationship between the two sentences one of contingency.
 These are all market excesses putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity , and what we 've seen is the market reining them in . ||| Of course , Washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday .|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence outlines the market excesses that the tax code places on debt over equity, and the market is resolving these excesses. The second sentence discusses Washington's actions leading up to the crisis, including their silence and the potential for confusion with the leverage equation. The contingency relationship is demonstrated through the context that the market's action (resolving the excesses) is dependent on the context provided in the first sentence (market overemphasis on the tax code). The market's response is contingent upon the market's actions and the market's resolving of excesses.
 Finally , according to Mr. Cardillo , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit , . ||| This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold|||Expansion|||Contingency|||The first sentence outlines Mr. Cardill's view that the strong dollar should be reflected in the August merchandise trade deficit. The second sentence discusses the potential negative impact on the dollar and its positive impact on gold. The contingency relationship is demonstrated here because Mr. Cardill's view (the second sentence) is contingent upon the potential negative impact on the dollar (the first sentence). His view is based on the potential positive effects on the dollar.
 Copper inventories in New York 's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons , to 10,004 tons . London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined 13,575 tons , to 89,300 tons . ||| The LME stocks decline was about as expected , but the Comex gain was n't .|||Comparison|||Contingency|||The first sentence states that copper inventories in New York's Commodity Exchange warehouses increased by 516 tons to reach 10,044 tons. The second sentence discusses the London Metal Exchange Exchange stock decline, noting that while the LME stocks declined, the Cox gain was not anticipated. The comparison relationship is evident as the text contrasts the increase in copper inventories with the anticipated decline in the NYSE stocks. This contrast highlights the difference in expectations between the two stocks.
